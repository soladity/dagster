# Changelog

## 0.6.3 (upcoming)

- Fix output materializations done against composite solid mapped outputs.

## 0.6.2

- Changed composition functions `@pipeline` and `@composite_solid` to automatically give solids
  aliases with an incrementing integer suffix when there are conflicts. This removes to the need
  to manually alias solid definitions that are used multiple times.
- Add `dagster schedule wipe` command to delete all schedules and remove all schedule cron jobs
- `execute_solid` test util now works on composite solids.
- Docs and example improvements: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/
- Added `--remote` flag to `dagster-graphql` for querying remote dagit servers.
- Fixed issue with duplicate run tag autocomplete suggestions in dagit (#1839)
- Fixed Windows 10 / py3.6+ bug causing pipeline execution failures

## 0.6.1

- Fixed an issue where Dagster public images tagged `latest` on Docker Hub were erroneously
  published with an older version of Dagster (#1814)
- Fixed an issue where the most recent scheduled run was not displayed in dagit (#1815)
- Fixed a bug with the `dagster schedule start --start-all` command (#1812)
- Added a new scheduler command to restart a schedule: `dagster schedule restart`. Also added a
  flag to restart all running schedules: `dagster schedule restart --restart-all-running`.

## 0.6.0

**New**

This major release includes features for scheduling, operating, and executing pipelines
that elevate dagit and dagster from a local development tool to a deployable service.

- `DagsterInstance` introduced as centralized system to control run, event, compute log,
  and local intermediates storage.
- A `Scheduler` abstraction has been introduced along side an initial implementation of
  `SystemCronScheduler` in `dagster-cron`.
- `dagster-aws` has been extended with a CLI for deploying dagster to AWS. This can spin
  up a Dagit node and all the supporting infrastructure—security group, RDS PostgreSQL
  instance, etc.—without having to touch the AWS console, and for deploying your code
  to that instance.
- **Dagit**
  - `Runs`: a completely overhauled Runs history page. Includes the ability to `Retry`,
    `Cancel`, and `Delete` pipeline runs from the new runs page.
  - `Scheduler`: a page for viewing and interacting with schedules.
  - `Compute Logs`: stdout and stderr are now viewable on a per execution step basis in each run.
    This is available in real time for currently executing runs and for historical runs.
  - A `Reload` button in the top right in dagit restarts the web-server process and updates
    the UI to reflect repo changes, including DAG structure, solid names, type names, etc.
    This replaces the previous file system watching behavior.

**Breaking Changes**

- `--log` and `--log-dir` no longer supported as CLI args. Existing runs and events stored
  via these flags are no longer compatible with current storage.
- `raise_on_error` moved from in process executor config to argument to arguments in
  python API methods such as `execute_pipeline`

## 0.5.9

- Fixes an issue using custom types for fan-in dependencies with intermediate storage.

## 0.5.8

- Fixes an issue running some Dagstermill notebooks on Windows.
- Fixes a transitive dependency issue with Airflow.
- Bugfixes, performance improvements, and better documentation.

## 0.5.7

- Fixed an issue with specifying composite output mappings (#1674)
- Added support for specifying
  [Dask worker resources](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/resources.html) (#1679)
- Fixed an issue with launching Dagit on Windows

## 0.5.6

- Execution details are now configurable. The new top-level `ExecutorDefinition` and `@executor`
  APIs are used to define in-process, multiprocess, and Dask executors, and may be used by users to
  define new executors. Like loggers and storage, executors may be added to a `ModeDefinition` and
  may be selected and configured through the `execution` field in the environment dict or YAML,
  including through Dagit. Executors may no longer be configured through the `RunConfig`.
- The API of dagster-dask has changed. Pipelines are now executed on Dask using the
  ordinary `execute_pipeline` API, and the Dask executor is configured through the environment.
  (See the dagster-dask README for details.)
- Added the `PresetDefinition.from_files` API for constructing a preset from a list of environment
  files (replacing the old usage of this class). `PresetDefinition` may now be directly
  instantiated with an environment dict.
- Added a prototype integration with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/).
- Added the dagster-bash library.
- Added the dagster-ssh library.
- Added the dagster-sftp library.
- Loosened the PyYAML compatibility requirement.
- The dagster CLI no longer takes a `--raise-on-error` or `--no-raise-on-error` flag. Set this
  option in executor config.
- Added a `MarkdownMetadataEntryData` class, so events yielded from client code may now render
  markdown in their metadata.
- Bug fixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to error display.

## 0.5.5

- Dagit now accepts parameters via environment variables prefixed with `DAGIT_`, e.g. `DAGIT_PORT`.
- Fixes an issue with reexecuting Dagstermill notebooks from Dagit.
- Bug fixes and display improvments in Dagit.

## 0.5.4

- Reworked the display of structured log information and system events in Dagit, including support
  for structured rendering of client-provided event metadata.
- Dagster now generates events when intermediates are written to filesystem and S3 storage, and
  these events are displayed in Dagit and exposed in the GraphQL API.
- Whitespace display styling in Dagit can now be toggled on and off.
- Bug fixes, display nits and improvements, and improvements to JS build process, including better
  display for some classes of errors in Dagit and improvements to the config editor in Dagit.

## 0.5.3

- Pinned RxPY to 1.6.1 to avoid breaking changes in 3.0.0 (py3-only).
- Most definition objects are now read-only, with getters corresponding to the previous properties.
- The `valueRepr` field has been removed from `ExecutionStepInputEvent` and `ExecutionStepOutputEvent`.
- Bug fixes and dagit UX improvements, including SQL highlighting and error handling.

## 0.5.2

- Added top-level `define_python_dagster_type` function.
- Renamed `metadata_fn` to `typecheck_metadata_fn` in all runtime type creation APIs.
- Renamed `result_value` and `result_values` to `output_value` and `output_values` on `SolidExecutionResult`
- Dagstermill: Reworked public API now contains only `define_dagstermill_solid`, `get_context`,
  `yield_event`, `yield_result`, `DagstermillExecutionContext`, `DagstermillError`, and
  `DagstermillExecutionError`. Please see the new
  [guide](https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.2/sections/learn/guides/data_science/data_science.html)
  for details.
- Bug fixes, including failures for some dagster CLI invocations and incorrect handling of Airflow
  timestamps.

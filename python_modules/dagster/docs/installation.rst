Installation
=======================

Dagster is tested on Python 3.6.6, 3.5.6, and 2.7.15. Python 3 is strongly
encouraged -- if you can, you won't regret making the switch!

Installing Python, pip, virtualenv, and yarn
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check that Python, the pip package manager, and virtualenv (highly
recommended) are already installed, you can run:
::
    python --version
    pip --version
    virtualenv --version

If these tools aren't present on your system, you can install them as follows:

On Ubuntu:
::
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install -U virtualenv  # system-wide install

On OSX, using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_:
::
    brew update
    brew install python  # Python 3
    sudo pip3 install -U virtualenv  # system-wide install

On Windows (Python 3):
- Install the *Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3*. This
  comes with *Visual Studio 2015* but can be installed separately as follows:
    1. Go to the Visual Studio downloads,
    2. Select *Redistributables and Build Tools*,
    3. Download and install the *Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable
       Update 3*.
- Install the 64-bit Python 3 release for Windows (select ``pip`` as an
  optional feature).
- Then run ``pip3 install -U pip virtualenv``

To use the dagit tool, you will also need to
`install yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/>`_.

Creating a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We strongly recommend installing dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If you are
running Anaconda, you should install dagster inside a Conda environment.

To create a virtual environment on Python 3, you can just run:
::
    $ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

This will create a new Python environment whose interpreter and libraries
are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and
(by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python installed as part
of your operating system.

On Python 2, you can use a tool like
`virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
to manage your virtual environments, or just run:

::
    $ virtualenv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

You'll then need to 'activate' the virtualenvironment, in bash by
running:
::
    $ source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
(For other shells, see the
`venv documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments>`_.)

If you are using Anaconda, you can run:
::
    $ conda create --name myenv

And then, on OSX or Ubuntu:
::
    $ source activate myenv

Or, on Windows:
::
    $ activate myenv

Installing the stable version from PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install dagster and dagit, run:
::
    pip install dagster
    pip install dagit

This will install the latest stable version of both packages.

Installing the dev version from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install the development version of the software, first clone the project
from Github:
::
    git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster.git

From the root of the repository, you can then run:
::
    pip install python_packages/dagster
    pushd python_packages/dagit/webapp
    yarn install
    yarn build
    popd
    pip install python_packages/dagit

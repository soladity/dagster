# Introduction

This project is our collection of Scala modules. You will almost certainly want to use IntelliJ IDEA to work on this project.

We'll eventually add `scalastyle` - for now, this is the only major editor config to put in place: [Case Class Definition Style](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26880974)

Spark is expected to be a provided dependency, so you should have a working Spark install somewhere
on `$SPARK_HOME`.

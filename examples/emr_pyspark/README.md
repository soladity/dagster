# Submitting PySpark solids on EMR

This example demonstrates how to have a solid run as a Spark step on an EMR cluster.  In it, the
`hello` solid will be executed on EMR.

It accomplishes this by using the `emr_pyspark_step_launcher`, which knows how to launch an EMR step
that runs the contents of a solid.  The example defines a mode that links the resource key
"pyspark_step_launcher" to the `emr_pyspark_step_launcher` resource definition, and then requires
that "pyspark_step_launcher" resource key for the solid which it wants to launch remotely.

`prod_resources.yaml` demonstrates how to configure an emr_pyspark_step_launcher.

The EMR PySpark step launcher relies on the presence of an s3_resource and s3 intermediate store to
shuttle config and events to and from EMR.

More generally, a step launcher is any resource that extends the StepLauncher abstract class,
whose methods can be invoked where a solid would otherwise be executed in-process to instead launch
a remote process with the solid running inside it.  To use a step launcher for a particular solid,
set a required resource key for the solid that points to that resource.

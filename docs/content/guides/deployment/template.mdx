## Description of X by itself

<TODO />

## Deployment Architecture

<!-- This diagram should show how the various dagster components are deployed on X. For example, in AWS:
    - The storages would be shown running on RDS
    - The dagster-daemon might be running in its own EC2 instance but networked to RDS
-->

## Dagster components

- What Dagster components need to be deployed?

  - Dagit, Daemon, Database, Run Worker, User Code

- Map Dagster components (daemon, dagit, DB, workers) to X component or cloud products

## Deployment Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create a dagster project

If you do not already have Dagster installed, follow the instructions on the [Installation](/getting-started/install) page.

Once you have Dagster installed, run the `new-project` command to scaffold a new project.

    $ dagster new-project

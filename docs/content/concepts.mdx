# Main Concepts

Dagster is a data orchestrator. It lets you define pipelines (DAGs) in terms of the data flow between reusable, logical components called solids. These pipelines can be developed and iterated locally and run anywhere.

## How to use the Main Concepts section

Each page in this section contains:

- **Overview**: Description of the concept.
- **Relevant APIs**: Index of top-level Dagster APIs that are relevant to the concept.
- **Examples**: Easy to copy code snippets for the concept.
- **Patterns**: A list of advanced patterns to use and anti-patterns to avoid with the concept.

## Sections

<LinkGrid>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="Solids and Pipelines"
    href="/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids"
  >
    Solids and Pipelines are the building blocks of Dagster code. You use these
    in conjunction to define execution graphs. This section covers how to define
    and use both solids and pipelines.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="Modes and Resources"
    href="/concepts/modes-resources/modes"
  >
    Modes, alongside resources, enable you to separate the pipeline logic from
    the environments and therefore make it easier to test and develop data
    pipelines in various environments.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Testing" href="/concepts/testing">
    Dagster enables you to build testable and maintainable data applications.
    This section shows that Dagster enables you to unit-test your data
    pipelines, separate business logic from environments for testing, and run
    data quality tests.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="Configuration System"
    href="/concepts/configuration/config-schema"
  >
    Dagster provides a configuration system that makes your data applications
    reliable and maintainable. This section demonstrates how configurations work
    with different Dagster entities.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Dagster Types" href="/concepts/types">
    Dagster includes facilities for typing the input and output values of solids
    (“runtime” types). This section explains how to define, use, and test types
    in Dagster.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="IO Management"
    href="/concepts/io-managements/io-managers"
  >
    IO Managers are user-provided objects that store solid outputs and load them
    as inputs to downstream solids. This section explains how Dagster thinks
    about IO management and shows how to define and use IO managers and other
    IO-related features.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Dagit & GraphQL API" href="/concepts/dagit/dagit">
    Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster
    objects. This section walks you through Dagit's functionalities and the
    GraphQL API used to interact with Dagster programatically.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="Repositories and Workspaces"
    href="/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids"
  >
    A workspace is a collection of user-defined repositories and information
    about where to find them. Dagster tools, like Dagit and the Dagster CLI, use
    workspaces to load user code. This section shows how to define and when to
    use repositories and workspaces.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem
    title="Schedules, Sensors, and Partitions"
    href="/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules"
  >
    Schedulers can launch runs on a fixed interval, while sensors allow you to
    run based on any external state change. This section demonstrates how to
    define them and their convenient capabilities like partitioning and
    backfilling.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Assets" href="/concepts/assets/asset-materializations">
    Assets are data objects that you produce during a pipeline run. This section
    walks you through how to inform Dagster about these assets so that they can
    be tracked over time.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Logging" href="/concepts/logging/loggers">
    Dagster includes a rich and extensible logging system. This section
    showcases Dagster's built-in logger and shows how you can customize loggers
    to fit your logging and monitoring infrastructure.
  </LinkGridItem>
  <LinkGridItem title="Executors" href="/concepts/executors/executors">
    Executors are responsible for executing steps within a pipeline run. This
    section explains how to define an executor to meet your computation needs.
  </LinkGridItem>

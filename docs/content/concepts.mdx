# Main Concepts

Dagster is a data orchestrator. The framework lets you define pipelines (DAGs) in terms of the data flow between reusable, logical components called solids. These pipelines can be developed and iterated on locally and run anywhere.

```python
@solid
def my_age(context):
  return 1

@solid
def my_name(context):
  return "Dagster"

@solid
def greet(context, age, name):
  context.log.info("Hello " + name + " (age)")

@pipeline
def my_pipeline(context):
  greet(my_age(), my_name())
```

## How to use the Main Concepts section

Each page in this section contains an:

- Overview: description of the concept
- Relevant APIs: Index of top level Dagster APIs that are relevant to the concept
- Examples: Easy to copy code snippets for the concept
- Patterns: A list of advanced patterns to use and anti-patterns to avoid with the concept

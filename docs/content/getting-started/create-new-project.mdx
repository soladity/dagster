# Create a New Project

This section will show you how to a create a new Dagster project and organize your files as you
build larger and larger pipelines. Dagster comes with a convenient CLI command for generating a
project skeleton, but you can also choose to organize your files differently as your project
evolves.

If you're completely new to Dagster, we recommend that you visit our [Tutorial](/tutorial) to learn
all the basic concepts of Dagster.

## Generating a Repository Skeleton

In Dagster, pipelines are grouped together into
[repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories). A _Dagster repository_ and a
_Git repository_ are two different concepts. Visit the
[Repositories overview](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories) for more details on Dagster
repositories.

If you're just starting a new Dagster project, the CLI command `dagster new-repo` will generate a
project skeleton with boilerplate code for development and testing. If you have `dagster`
installed in your Python environment, then you can run the following shell command to generate
a Dagster project called `REPO_NAME`:

```bash
dagster new-repo REPO_NAME
cd REPO_NAME
```

The newly generated `REPO_NAME` directory is in fact a fully functioning
[Python package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) and can be installed with
`pip`. This Python package is considered a _repository location_ in Dagster. A single Python file
can also be a repository location, like in the [Hello World](/getting-started/hello-world) guide.
For more details about different types of repository locations, visit the
[Repositories overview](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories).

Here's a breakdown of the files and directories that are generated:

| File/Directory | Description |
|-|-|
| `REPO_NAME/` | A Python module that contains code for your new Dagster repository |
| `REPO_NAME_tests/` | A Python module that contains tests for `REPO_NAME` |
| `workspace.yaml` | A file that specifies the location of the user code for Dagit and the Dagster CLI. Visit the [Workspaces overview](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces) for more details. |
| `README.md` | A description and guide for your new code repository |
| `setup.py` | A build script with Python package dependencies for your new code repository |

Inside of the directory `REPO_NAME/`, the following files and directories are generated:

| File/Directory | Description |
|-|-|
| `REPO_NAME/solids/` | A Python module that contains SolidDefinitions, which represent individual units of computation |
| `REPO_NAME/pipelines/` | A Python module that contains PipelineDefinitions, which are built up from solids |
| `REPO_NAME/schedules/` | A Python module that contains ScheduleDefinitions, to trigger recurring pipeline runs based on time |
| `REPO_NAME/sensors/` | A Python module that contains SensorDefinitions, to trigger pipeline runs based on external state |
| `REPO_NAME/repository.py` | A Python file that contains a RepositoryDefinition, to specify which pipelines, schedules, and sensors are available in your repository |

This file structure is a good starting point and suitable for most Dagster projects. As you build
more and more pipelines, you may eventually find your own way of structuring your code that works
best for you.

## Local Development

1. Install your repository as a Python package. By
   using the `--editable` flag, `pip` will install your repository in
   ["editable mode"](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/reference/pip_install/?highlight=editable#editable-installs)
   so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

2. Start the Dagit process. This will start a Dagit web server that, by default, is served on
   http://localhost:3000.

```bash
dagit
```

The Dagit process automatically uses the file `workspace.yaml` to find where your repository
location(s), from which Dagster will load your pipelines, schedules, and sensors. To see how you can
customize the Dagit process, run `dagit --help`.

3. (Optional) If you want to enable Dagster
   [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or
   [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) for your pipelines, start the
   [Dagster Daemon process](/deployment/dagster-daemon) **in a different shell or terminal**:

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

Once your Dagster Daemon process is running, you should be able to enable schedules and sensors for
your Dagster pipelines in your repository.

## Local Testing

Once you have created a new Dagster repository with the CLI command `dagster new-repo`, you can find
tests in `REPO_NAME_tests`, where `REPO_NAME` is the name of your repository. You can run all of
your tests with the following command:

```bash
pytest REPO_NAME_tests
```

As you create Dagster solids and pipelines, add tests in `REPO_NAME_tests/` to check that your
code behaves as desired and does not break over time.

For hints on how to write tests for solids and pipelines in Dagster,
[see our documentation tutorial on Testing](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/testable).

## Deployment

Once your Dagster project is ready, visit the [Deployment Guides](/deployment) to learn
how to run Dagster in production environments, such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2, etc.

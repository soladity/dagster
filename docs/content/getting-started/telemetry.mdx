# Telemetry

As an open source project, we collect usage statistics to better understand how users engage with
Dagster and to inform development priorities. Telemetry data will motivate projects such as adding
functionality in frequently-used parts of the CLI and will help us understand adoption of new
features.

We will not see or store any data that is processed within solids and pipelines. We will not see or
store solid definitions (including generated context) or pipeline definitions (including modes and
resources).

The telemetry-instrumented functions are:

```python file=../../../python_modules/dagster/dagster/core/telemetry.py startafter=start_TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS endbefore=end_TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS
TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS = {
    "_launch_scheduled_executions",
    "_logged_execute_pipeline",
    "execute_execute_command",
    "execute_launch_command",
}
```

To see the logs we send, open `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs/` if `$DAGSTER_HOME` is set or `~/.dagster/logs/`
if not set (after calling the instrumented functions).

If you'd like to opt-out, you can add the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` (creating that
file if necessary):

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```

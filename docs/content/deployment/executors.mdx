## Overview

Executors are responsible for executing steps within a job run. Once a run has launched and the process for the run, or run worker, has been allocated and started, the executor assumes responsibility for execution. Executors can range from single-process serial executors all the way to managing per-step computational resources with a sophisticated control plane.

Every job has an executor. The default executor is the <PyObject object="multiprocess_executor" />, which executes each step in its own process. You can choose the executor for a job by supplying an <PyObject object="ExecutorDefinition" /> to the `executor_def` parameter of <PyObject object="job" decorator /> or <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" />.

Executing a job via <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" />, overrides the job's executor and uses <PyObject object="in_process_executor" /> instead.

Example executors include:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="in_process_executor" />: Execution plan
  executes serially within the run worker itself.
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />: Each step
  executes within its own spawned process. Has configurable level of
  parallelism.
- <PyObject module="dagster_dask" object="dask_executor" />: Executes each step
  within a dask task.
- <PyObject module="dagster_celery" object="celery_executor" />: Executes each
  step within a celery task.
- <PyObject module="dagster_celery_docker" object="celery_docker_executor" />:
  Executes each step within a Docker container.
- <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="celery_k8s_job_executor" />:
  Executes each step within a ephemeral kubernetes pod, using celery as a
  control plane for prioritization, queuing, and so forth.
- <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="k8s_job_executor" />: Executes each
  step within an ephemeral kubernetes pod.

## Custom Executors

The executor system is pluggable, and it is possible to write your own executor to target a different execution substrate. This is not well-documented, and the internal APIs continue to be in flux.

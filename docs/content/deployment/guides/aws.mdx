# Deploying Dagster to AWS

To deploy Dagster to AWS, EC2 or ECS can host Dagit, RDS can store runs and events, and S3 can act as an IO manager.

## Hosting Dagit or Dagster Daemon on EC2 or ECS

To host Dagit or Dagster Daemon on a bare VM or in Docker on EC2 or ECS, see [Running Dagster as a service](/deployment/guides/service).

## Using RDS for run and event log storage

You can use a hosted RDS PostgreSQL database for your Dagster run/events
data. You can do this by setting blocks in your
`$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` appropriately.

```python file=/deploying/dagster-pg.yaml
run_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.run_storage
  class: PostgresRunStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { database }
      port: { port }

event_log_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.event_log
  class: PostgresEventLogStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }

schedule_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.schedule_storage
  class: PostgresScheduleStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }
```

In this case, you'll want to ensure you provide the right connection
strings for your RDS instance, and ensure that the node or container
hosting Dagit is able to connect to RDS.

Be sure that this file is present, and _DAGSTER_HOME_ is
set, on the node where Dagit is running.

Note that using RDS for run and event log storage does not require that
Dagit be running in the cloud. If you are connecting a local Dagit
instance to a remote RDS storage, double check that your local node is
able to connect to RDS.

## Using S3 for intermediates storage (WIP)

To enable parallel computation (e.g., with the multiprocessing or
Dagster celery executors), you will also need to configure persistent
intermediate storage -- for instance, using an S3 bucket to store
intermediates.

You'll first need to need to add S3 storage to your **`ModeDefinition`**.

```python
from dagster_aws.s3.resources import s3_resource
from dagster_aws.s3.system_storage import s3_plus_default_intermediate_storage_defs
from dagster import ModeDefinition

prod_mode = ModeDefinition(
    name='prod',
    intermediate_storage_defs=s3_plus_default_intermediate_storage_defs,
    resource_defs={'s3': s3_resource}
)
```

Then, just add the following YAML block in your pipeline config:

```yaml
intermediate_storage:
  s3:
    config:
      s3_bucket: your-s3-bucket-name
```

The resource uses `boto` under the hood, so if you are accessing your private buckets you will
need to provide the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables
or follow one of the other boto authentication methods.

With this in place, your pipeline runs will store intermediates on S3 in
the location
`s3://<bucket>/dagster/storage/<pipeline run id>/intermediates/<solid name>.compute`

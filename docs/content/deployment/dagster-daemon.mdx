# Dagster Daemon

Several Dagster features, like [schedules](/overview/schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/overview/schedules-sensors/sensors),
and [run queueing](/overview/pipeline-runs/limiting-run-concurrency), require a long-running `dagster-daemon` process to be included
with your deployment.

To start the `dagster-daemon` process locally, launch the following command and keep the process running:

```shell
$ dagster-daemon run
```

Check the [Deployment Guides](/deploying/#hands-on-guides-to-deploying-dagster) section for more information on how to deploy the daemon in
other environments, like Docker or Kubernetes.

## Available daemons

The `dagster-daemon` process reads from your [Dagster instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) file to
determine which daemons it should include. Each of those daemons then runs on a regular interval.

The following daemons are currently available:

- The _scheduler daemon_ is responsible for creating runs from any [schedules](/overview/schedules-sensors/schedules) that
  are turned on. This daemon will run as long as you have not overridden the default <PyObject module="dagster.core.scheduler" object="DagsterDaemonScheduler" />
  as the scheduler on your instance.

- The _run queue daemon_ is responsible for launching queued runs, taking into account any limits and prioritization
  rules you've set on your instance. You can enable this daemon by setting the
  [run coordinator](/overview/pipeline-runs/run-coordinator) on your
  instance to <PyObject module="dagster.core.run_coordinator" object="QueuedRunCoordinator" />.

- The _sensor daemon_ is responsible for creating runs from any
  [sensors](/overview/schedules-sensors/sensors) that are turned on. This daemon is always enabled.

## Daemons in Dagit

To check the status of your `dagster-daemon` process within Dagit, click on "Status" in the left nav.
This will take you a page where you can see information about each daemon that's currently configured on your instance.

Each daemon periodically writes a heartbeat to your instance storage, so if a daemon doesn't show a
recent heartbeat on this page, it likely indicates that you should check the logs from your `dagster-daemon`
process for errors.

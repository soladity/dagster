# Advanced: Scheduling Job Runs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/" />

Dagster includes a scheduler that allows you to run jobs at regular intervals, e.g. daily or hourly.

## Defining schedules

As before, we've defined a op and a job.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py startafter=start_scheduler_marker_0 endbefore=end_scheduler_marker_0
import csv
from datetime import datetime

import requests
from dagster import get_dagster_logger, job, op, repository, schedule


@op
def hello_cereal(context):
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereals = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]
    date = context.op_config["date"]
    get_dagster_logger().info(
        f"Today is {date}. Found {len(cereals)} cereals."
    )


@job
def hello_cereal_job():
    hello_cereal()
```

Suppose that we need to run our simple cereal job every morning before breakfast, at 6:45 AM. To do this, we'll write a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to define our schedule. We can either directly construct a `ScheduleDefinition`, or use one of the included schedule decorators.

In this example, we'll use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="schedule" displayText="@schedule" /> decorator, which runs a schedule once a day at a specified time.

The decorated function should return the `run_config` needed to run the schedule at the specified execution time. The function is passed the datetime for which the schedule is running.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py startafter=start_scheduler_marker_1 endbefore=end_scheduler_marker_1
@schedule(
    cron_schedule="45 6 * * *",
    job=hello_cereal_job,
    execution_timezone="US/Central",
)
def good_morning_schedule(context):
    date = context.scheduled_execution_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    return {"ops": {"hello_cereal": {"config": {"date": date}}}}
```

To complete the picture, we'll need to add the schedule definition to the list of definitions returned from our repository.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py startafter=start_scheduler_marker_2 endbefore=end_scheduler_marker_2
@repository
def hello_cereal_repository():
    return [hello_cereal_job, good_morning_schedule]
```

## Starting schedules

Now, we can load Dagit to view the schedule, start and stop it, and monitor the runs it creates:

```bash
dagit -f scheduler.py
```

The left sidebar of Dagit now displays a clock icon next to each job with a schedule.

<Image
alt="schedules.png"
src="/images/tutorial/schedules.png"
width={3478}
height={2184}
/>

Clicking on `good_morning_schedule` or the clock icon will take us to the Schedules view. From here, we can turn on the schedule by pressing the toggle button, at which point Dagit will show us that the schedule is running and will next execute tomorrow at 6:45 AM.

/>

### Running the schedule

Dagster's default scheduler requires you to launch a long-running `dagster-daemon` process in addition to Dagit.

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

This process will periodically check for any running schedules and launch their associated runs. If you leave this process running, it will launch a new run for your schedule each day at the expected time.

### Schedule filters

If you need to customize the times at which the schedule should execute, you can pass a function as the `should_execute` argument to <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />.

For example, we can define a filter that only returns _`True`_ on weekdays:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py startafter=start_scheduler_marker_3 endbefore=end_scheduler_marker_3
def weekday_filter(_context):
    weekno = datetime.today().weekday()
    # Returns true if current day is a weekday
    return weekno < 5
```

If we combine this `should_execute` filter with a schedule that runs at 6:45am every day, then we'll have a schedule that runs at 6:45am only on weekdays.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py startafter=start_scheduler_marker_4 endbefore=end_scheduler_marker_4
@schedule(
    cron_schedule="45 6 * * *",
    job=hello_cereal_job,
    execution_timezone="US/Central",
    should_execute=weekday_filter,
)
def good_weekday_morning_schedule(context):
    date = context.scheduled_execution_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    return {"ops": {"hello_cereal": {"inputs": {"date": {"value": date}}}}}
```

# Configuring Solids

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/" />

In many situations, we'd like to be able to configure solids at run time. For example, we may want whomever is running the pipeline to decide what dataset it operates on. Configuration is useful when you want the person or system that is launching a pipeline to be able to make choices about what the pipeline does, without needing to modify the pipeline definition.

We've seen a solid whose behavior is the same every time it runs:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/read_csv.py startafter=start_load_cereals_marker endbefore=end_load_cereals_marker
@solid
def load_cereals(context):
    csv_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "cereal.csv")
    with open(csv_path, "r") as fd:
        cereals = [row for row in csv.DictReader(fd)]

    context.log.info(f"Found {len(cereals)} cereals".format())
    return cereals
```

If we want the file to be determined by whomever is launching the pipeline, we might write a more generic version:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/read_csv.py startafter=start_read_csv_marker endbefore=end_read_csv_marker
@solid
def read_csv(context):
    csv_path = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(__file__), context.solid_config["csv_name"]
    )
    with open(csv_path, "r") as fd:
        lines = [row for row in csv.DictReader(fd)]

    context.log.info(f"Read {len(lines)} lines")
    return lines
```

Here, rather than hard-coding the value of `dataset_path`, we use a config option, `csv_name`.

Let's rebuild a pipeline we've seen before, but this time using our newly parameterized solid.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/configurable_pipeline.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
import csv
import os

from dagster import execute_pipeline, pipeline, solid


@solid
def read_csv(context):
    csv_path = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(__file__), context.solid_config["csv_name"]
    )
    with open(csv_path, "r") as fd:
        lines = [row for row in csv.DictReader(fd)]

    context.log.info(f"Read {len(lines)} lines")
    return lines


@solid
def sort_by_calories(context, cereals):
    sorted_cereals = sorted(
        cereals, key=lambda cereal: int(cereal["calories"])
    )

    context.log.info(f'Most caloric cereal: {sorted_cereals[-1]["name"]}')


@pipeline
def configurable_pipeline():
    sort_by_calories(read_csv())
```

## Specifying Config for Pipeline Execution

We can specify config for a pipeline execution regardless of how we execute the pipeline — the Dagit UI, Python API, or the command line:

### Dagit Config Editor

Dagit provides a powerful, schema-aware, typeahead-enabled config editor to enable rapid experimentation with and debugging of parameterized pipeline executions. As always, run:

```bash
dagit -f configurable_pipeline.py
```

Notice that the launch execution button is disabled and the solids are red in the bottom right corner of the Playground.

Let's enter the config we need in order to execute our pipeline.

src="/images/tutorial/inputs_figure_three.png"

height={946}
/>

### Config in Python API

We previously encountered the <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline"
displayText="execute_pipeline()" />function. Pipeline run config is specified by the second argument to this function, which must be a dict.

This dict contains all of the user-provided configuration with which to execute a pipeline. As such, it can have [a lot of sections](/\_apidocs/execution), but we'll only use one of them here: per-solid configuration, which is specified under the key `solids`:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/configurable_pipeline.py startafter=start_run_config_marker endbefore=end_run_config_marker
run_config = {
        "solids": {"read_csv": {"config": {"csv_name": "cereal.csv"}}}
    }
```

The `solids` dict is keyed by solid name, and each solid is configured by a dict that may itself have several sections. In this case, we are interested in the `config` section.

Now you can pass this run config to <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline"
displayText="execute_pipeline()" />:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/configurable_pipeline.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
result = execute_pipeline(configurable_pipeline, run_config=run_config)
```

### YAML fragments and Dagster CLI

When executing pipelines with the Dagster CLI, we'll need to provide the run config in a file. We use YAML for the file-based representation of configuration, but the values are the same as before:

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/run_config.yaml
solids:
  read_csv:
    config:
      csv_name: "cereal.csv"
```

We can pass config files in this format to the Dagster CLI tool with the `-c` flag.

```bash
dagster pipeline execute -f configurable_pipeline.py -c run_config.yaml
```

In practice, you might have different sections of your run config in different yaml files—if, for instance, some sections change more often (e.g. in test and prod) while other are more static. In this case, you can set multiple instances of the `-c` flag on CLI invocations, and the CLI tools will assemble the YAML fragments into a single run config.

## Putting Schema on a Config

The implementation of the `read_csv` solid we wrote above expects the provided configuration will look a particular way. I.e. that it will include a key called "csv_name" and an accompanying value that is a string. If someone running the pipeline were to neglect to provide config, the solid would fail with a `KeyError` when it tried to fetch the value for "csv_name" from `context.solid_config`. If the provided value were an integer and not a string, the solid would also fail, because paths are strings.

Dagster allows specifying a "config schema" on any configurable object to help catch these kinds of errors early. Here's a version of `read_csv` that includes a `config_schema`. With this version, if we try to pass config that doesn't match the expected schema, Dagster can tell us immediately.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/configuring_solids/config_schema.py startafter=start_read_csv_marker endbefore=end_read_csv_marker
@solid(config_schema={"csv_name": str})
def read_csv(context):
    csv_path = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(__file__), context.solid_config["csv_name"]
    )
    with open(csv_path, "r") as fd:
        lines = [row for row in csv.DictReader(fd)]

    context.log.info(f"Read {len(lines)} lines")
    return lines
```

The <PyObject module="dagster" object="ConfigSchema" /> documentation describes all the ways that you can provide config schema, including optional config fields, default values, and collections.

In addition to catching errors early, config schemas are also useful for documenting pipelines and learning how to use them. This is particularly useful when launching pipelines from inside Dagit.

Because of the config schema we've provided, Dagit knows that this pipeline requires configuration in order to run without errors.

Go back to the Playground and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> in order to bring up the typeahead assistant.

# Using dbt with Dagster

This guide explains how you can run a [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) project as part of a Dagster job.

## What is dbt?

[dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) (data build tool) helps engineers transform data in their warehouses by simply writing `SELECT` statements. dbt automatically builds a dependency graph for your transformations and turns these `SELECT` statements into tables and views in your data warehouse.

dbt not only runs your data transformations, but also can create data quality tests and generate documentation for your data, right out of the box. To learn more about dbt, visit [the official dbt documentation website](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction).

## How does dbt work with Dagster?

Dagster orchestrates dbt alongside _other technologies_, so you can combine dbt with Spark, Python, etc. in a single job. Dagster also provides built-in operational and data observability capabilities, like storing dbt run results longitudinally and sending alerts when a dbt run fails.

`dagster-dbt` is an integration library that provides pre-built resources for using dbt together with Dagster. These are all designed to be configurable for any dbt project.

The resources that dagster_dbt provides are

- `dbt_cli_resource` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='DbtCliResource'/>): for running dbt CLI commands
- `dbt_rpc_resource` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='DbtRpcResource'/>): for sending dbt commands to an RPC server
- `dbt_rpc_sync_resource` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='DbtRpcSyncResource'/>): for sending dbt commands to an RPC server and polling until they complete

Each resource derives from the same base class, <PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='DbtResource'/>, which provides a consistent python interface for interacting with dbt.

This library also provides pre-built ops that take advantage of these resources. These exist solely for convenience (they just run the underlying resource command and return the result), and if you have more complex use cases that require some degree of customization, it's recommended that you build your own ops that use these resources. These ops are compatible with all of the aforementioned dbt resources:

- `dbt_run_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_run_op'/>)
- `dbt_compile_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_compile_op'/>)
- `dbt_ls_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_ls_op'/>)
- `dbt_test_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_test_op'/>)
- `dbt_snapshot_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_snapshot_op'/>)
- `dbt_seed_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_seed_op'/>)
- `dbt_docs_generate_op` (<PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='dbt_docs_generate_op'/>)

To view example jobs that take advantage of this dbt integration, check out either the [Hacker News example repo](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/examples/hacker_news/hacker_news/jobs/dbt_metrics.py) or the [dbt example repo](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dbt_example).

## Using the dbt CLI resource in a Dagster job

`dagster-dbt` provides a `dbt_cli_resource` to help make it easy to run commands through the [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview).

When you supply this resource to an op, you can call any of the many provided methods to invoke that particular CLI command. You can check out a full list of functions (as well as their signatures) in the <PyObject module='dagster_dbt' object='DbtCliResource'/> API Docs. All methods on the resource will return a <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DbtCliOutput"/> object.

To run dbt CLI commands, your dbt project directory must be on your local filesystem and you must have a dbt profile already set up to connect to your data warehouse. Visit [the official dbt CLI documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/cli-overview) for more details.

### Configuration

When you are configuring the `dbt_cli_resource`, you have a number of options available to you. Here, you're able to specify any command line options that you'd want to pass into all of your dbt commands.

Typically, you'll want to configure your `project_dir` here, as in most cases, you will only be working with a single dbt project in a given job, and wouldn't want to have to pass in this option to every function call. You might want to configure your `profiles_dir`, or the specific `profile` you'll be using for similar reasons.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_resource_config endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_resource_config dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource

my_dbt_resource = dbt_cli_resource.configured(
    {
        "project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project",
        "profiles_dir": "path/to/dbt/profiles",
    }
)
```

While the config schema doesn't have an option for every single dbt flag (as some flags only work with certain commands), if you configure a flag that is not in the schema, it will still get passed into every cli invocation, exactly the same as the pre-defined config options.

There are also a few options that are not associated with command line flags, which may be useful. These are:

- `warn_error`: will raise an error for issues that dbt would normally just warn on
- `target_path`: the dbt target path, if you set it to something other than the default
- `dbt_executable`: the name of the specific dbt executable you're using, if it's not just `dbt`

### CLI Examples

Below are some examples of using `dagster_dbt` library to run a `dbt` project via the CLI.

For these examples, we make heavy use of the `dbt_cli_resource`. This resource has methods corresponding to most dbt commands (such as `run`, `seed`, `test`, `ls`, etc.). The methods behave essentially identically to each other, so these examples will focus on `dbt run` for simplicity.

The `dagster_dbt` library provides ops that simplify cases where you simply wish to run a single one of these commands (with no special arguments) and return the result. This saves you from having to write out the boilerplate associated with creating an op from scratch. However, it's fairly common to have more complex needs, and in those cases you should create your own custom op that invokes the resource directly. The below examples will mix and match these two approaches where appropriate.

Note that you can pass in any keyword to these functions that you wish, and they will get added as flags to the underlying dbt command (e.g. `my_flag_name = 'foo'` will get converted to `--my-flag-name foo`). If there is a dbt option that you would like to set, but is not reflected in the function signature, this is how you would do so.

#### Using dbt_cli_resource to run your entire dbt project

One common way to use this integration is to have the resource run all of the models in a dbt project. To do this, just configure the resource so it knows where your dbt project is, and

and fire off a `dbt.run()` command!

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_run endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_run dedent=4
from dagster import job
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, dbt_run_op

my_dbt_resource = dbt_cli_resource.configured({"project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project"})

@job(resource_defs={"dbt": my_dbt_resource})
def my_dbt_job():
    dbt_run_op()
```

This is essentially equivalent to the following code:

#### Using dbt_cli_resource to run a specific set of models

Sometimes, you just want to run a select set of models in your dbt project, rather than the entire thing. The below examples show two ways of doing this, depending on your use case.

Note that in both cases, the `models` option takes in a list of strings. The string `"tag:staging"` uses [dbt's node selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax) to filter models with the tag `"staging"`. For more details, [visit the official dbt documentation on the node selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax).

##### **... with configuration**

If you know what models you want to select ahead of time, you might prefer specifying this while configuring your resource. Because you aren't specifying any specific arguments at runtime, you can use the prebuilt `dbt_run_op`, instead of writing your own.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_run_specific_models_preconfig endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_run_specific_models_preconfig dedent=4
from dagster import job
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, dbt_run_op

my_dbt_resource = dbt_cli_resource.configured(
    {"project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project", "models": ["tag:staging"]}
)

@job(resource_defs={"dbt": my_dbt_resource})
def my_dbt_job():
    dbt_run_op()
```

##### **... supplying an argument**

If you want to change which models you select depending on what happens during execution, you should create your own op that invokes the dbt resource (rather than using a prebuilt op). This allows you to explicitly set the `models` parameter at runtime. This would look similar to the following:

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_run_specific_models_runtime endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_run_specific_models_runtime dedent=4
from dagster import op

@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def run_models(context, some_condition: bool):
    if some_condition:
        context.resources.dbt.run(models=["tag:staging"])
    else:
        context.resources.dbt.run(models=["tag:other"])
```

#### Using a different dbt profile for different dagster modes

Dagster supports [multiple jobs for the same graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs#from-a-graph). dbt has a similar concept, [profiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile). You might want to run a dev version of your graph that targets the development-specific dbt profile, and then have a prod version that runs using the prod dbt profile. This example shows how to accomplish this.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_profile_modes endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_profile_modes dedent=4
from dagster import graph
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, dbt_run_op

@graph
def my_dbt():
    dbt_run_op()

my_dbt_graph_dev = my_dbt.to_job(
    resource_defs={
        "dbt": dbt_cli_resource.configured(
            {"project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project", "profile": "dev"}
        )
    }
)

my_dbt_graph_prod = my_dbt.to_job(
    resource_defs={
        "dbt": dbt_cli_resource.configured(
            {"project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project", "profile": "prod"}
        )
    }
)
```

#### Invoking multiple dbt commands in the same job

Sometimes, you'll want to run multiple different dbt commands in the same job. The `dbt_cli_resource` makes this convenient, as you only need to configure your dbt resource once, and all of that configuration will already be set for any ops that are using this resource.

One common use case would be to first run `dbt run` to update all of your models, and then run `dbt test` to check that they all are working as expected, seen below.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_cli_run_after_another_op endbefore=end_marker_dbt_cli_run_after_another_op dedent=4
from dagster import job
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, dbt_run_op, dbt_test_op

my_dbt_resource = dbt_cli_resource.configured({"project_dir": "path/to/dbt/project"})

@job(resource_defs={"dbt": my_dbt_resource})
def my_dbt_job():
    dbt_test_op(start_after=dbt_run_op())
```

## Using a dbt RPC server in a Dagster job

This integration provides two separate resources to help run commands against a [dbt RPC server](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/rpc). The `dbt_rpc_resource` will fire off requests against the server and return immediately, while the `dbt_rpc_sync_resource` will poll the server until each request completes.

The prebuilt ops provided by `dagster-dbt` (such as `dbt_run_op`, `dbt_test_op`, etc.) are all compatible with both of these resources.

### Configuration

Your dbt RPC server can be running locally or remotely. To interact with the RPC server in your Dagster job, you will need to create a resource for your dbt RPC server.

`dagster_dbt.dbt_rpc_resource` can be configured with your specific host and port.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_rpc_resource endbefore=end_marker_dbt_rpc_resource dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import dbt_rpc_resource

my_remote_rpc = dbt_rpc_resource.configured({"host": "80.80.80.80", "port": 8080})
```

For convenience during local development, you may also use `dagster_dbt.local_dbt_rpc_resource`, which is preconfigured for a dbt RPC server that is running on `http://localhost:8580`.

### RPC Examples

#### Running a dbt project over RPC

All of the prebuilt dbt ops in this library are compatible with the `dbt_rpc_resource` (which sends requests and then exists immediately) and the `dbt_rpc_sync_resource` (which sends requests and waits for the task to complete). Therefore, we can use the same ops as in the CLI examples as long as we provide the correct resource to the job.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_rpc_run endbefore=end_marker_dbt_rpc_run dedent=4
from dagster import job
from dagster_dbt import dbt_run_op

@job(resource_defs={"dbt": my_remote_rpc})
def my_dbt_job():
    dbt_run_op()
```

#### Running specific models in a dbt project over RPC

This is similar to having `"params": {"models": "tag:staging"}` in your dbt RPC request body.

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_rpc_run_specific_models endbefore=end_marker_dbt_rpc_run_specific_models dedent=4
from dagster import job, op
from dagster_dbt import dbt_rpc_resource

my_remote_rpc = dbt_rpc_resource.configured({"host": "80.80.80.80", "port": 8080})

@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def run_staging_models(context):
    context.resources.dbt.run(models=["tag:staging"])

@job(resource_defs={"dbt": my_remote_rpc})
def my_dbt_job():
    run_staging_models()
```

Note that the job above will NOT wait until the dbt RPC server has finished executing your request. Instead, it will return immediately with a request token from the dbt RPC server. If you want the op to wait until execution is finished, instead supply a `dbt_rpc_sync_resource` (seen below).

#### Running a dbt project and polling the RPC server until it has finished executing

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_rpc_run_and_wait endbefore=end_marker_dbt_rpc_run_and_wait dedent=4
from dagster import job, op
from dagster_dbt import dbt_rpc_sync_resource

my_remote_sync_rpc = dbt_rpc_sync_resource.configured({"host": "80.80.80.80", "port": 8080})

@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt_sync"})
def run_staging_models_and_wait(context):
    context.resources.dbt.run(models=["tag:staging"])

@job(resource_defs={"dbt_sync": my_remote_sync_rpc})
def my_dbt_job():
    run_staging_models_and_wait()
```

## Use dbt Cloud in a Dagster job

`dagster_dbt` currently does not provide ops or resources for invoking dbt commands via dbt Cloud. However, this use case is possible by writing your own op to create and start Jobs via [the dbt Cloud API](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-api). For more details about each HTTP endpoint, [visit the official documentation for the dbt Cloud API](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api).

## Advanced Configuration

For full documentation on all available config, [visit the API docs for dagster-dbt](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster_dbt).

**Generating Asset Materializations when you run your dbt project**

`dagster_dbt` is configured to automatically create [Asset Materializations](/concepts/assets/asset-materializations) for each of your dbt models when you run the `run` command (via either the CLI or over RPC). These materializations are populated with metadata that is automatically parsed from the dbt response. The available metadata differs between dbt versions. If there's anything you would like to add to these materializations, you can explicitly invoke the underlying <PyObject module='dagster_dbt.utils' object='generate_materializations'/> utility function, and modify each of the resulting materializations like so:

```python file=/integrations/dbt.py startafter=start_marker_dbt_asset_mats endbefore=end_marker_dbt_asset_mats dedent=4
from dagster import op, Output
from dagster_dbt.utils import generate_materializations

@op(required_resource_keys={"dbt"})
def dbt_run_with_custom_assets(context):
    dbt_result = context.resources.dbt.run()
    for materialization in generate_materializations(dbt_result):
        yield materialization._replace(
            metadata_entries=[...]  # insert whatever metadata you want here
        )
    yield Output(dbt_result)
```

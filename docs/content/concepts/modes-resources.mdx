# Modes and Resources

Resources provide a way to manage dependencies to external APIs. Together with modes, they can be used to represent multiple different execution environments for a pipeline.

## Overview

You can use **resources** to access features of the execution environments to solids during pipeline execution. You can use **modes** to bind a set of resources (and other environment information) to a pipeline so that those resources can be available to the solids within a pipeline. You can provide multiple modes to a pipeline, each with different resources, to represent the execution environments that your pipeline will be run within.

### Why Use Resources and Modes

Representing external dependencies as resources, in conjunction with modes, have very convenient properties:

- **Pluggable**: You can map a resource to a key in one mode, and then map a different resource to that same key in a different mode. This is useful if there is a heavy external dependency that you want to use in production, but avoid using it in testing. You can simply provide different modes for each execution case: one for production with the heavy dependency (e.g., AWS) as a resource, and one for testing with something lighter (i.e., in-memory store) mapped to the same key. For more information about this capability, check out [Separating Business Logic from Environments](/concepts/testing#separating-business-logic-from-environments).
- **Pipeline Scoped**: Since resources are pipeline scoped, if you provide a resource to a mode, then it becomes available for use with every solid in that pipeline.
- **Configurable**: Resources can be configured, using a strongly typed [configuration system](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).
- **Dependencies**: Resources can depend on other resources. This makes it possible to cleanly represent external environment objects that rely on other external environment information for initialization.

## Defining a Resource

To define a resource, use the <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator. Wrap a function that takes an `init_context` as the first parameter, which is an instance of <PyObject object="InitResourceContext"/>. From this function, return or yield the object that you would like to be available as a resource.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_resource_example endbefore=end_resource_example
class ExternalCerealFetcher:
    def fetch_new_cereals(self, start_ts, end_ts):
        pass


@resource
def cereal_fetcher(init_context):
    return ExternalCerealFetcher()
```

## Defining a Mode

To define a mode, construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ModeDefinition" displayText="ModeDefinition"/>. Each resource definition provided to the mode should be mapped to a unique key.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_mode_example endbefore=end_mode_example
mode_def_ab = ModeDefinition(
    "ab_mode",
    resource_defs={
        "a": resource_a,
        "b": resource_b,
    },
)
```

## Providing Modes to a Pipeline

Modes can be provided to a pipeline via the `mode_defs` argument on the <PyObject object="pipeline" decorator/> decorator.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_pipeline_example endbefore=end_pipeline_example
@pipeline(mode_defs=[mode_def_ab, mode_def_c])
def pipeline_with_mode():
    basic_solid()
```

## Selecting a Mode during Execution

### Python API

When executing a pipeline using <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" />, you can toggle between modes by providing the mode name to the `mode` parameter.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_execute_example endbefore=end_execute_example
execute_pipeline(pipeline_with_mode, mode="ab_mode")
```

### In Dagit

When Launching the pipeline via the Dagit Playground, you can select a mode from the mode selector dropdown:

![Modes in Dagit](/images/concepts/modes-resources/modes-dagit.png)

### Dagster CLI

When launching a pipeline via the CLI, you can use the `-d` option to specify the mode.

    $ dagster pipeline execute -d prod_mode my_pipeline

## Examples

### Resource Configuration

<PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" pluralize /> can have a config schema, which
allows you to customize behavior at runtime through pipeline configuration.

For example, let's say we wanted to pass a connection string to our `DatabaseConnection` resource.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_resource_config endbefore=end_resource_config
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, connection: str):
        self.connection = connection


@resource(config_schema={"connection": str})
def db_resource(init_context):
    connection = init_context.resource_config["connection"]
    return DatabaseConnection(connection)
```

### Resource to Resource Dependencies

Resources can depend upon other resources. Use the `required_resource_keys` parameter of the <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator to specify which resources to depend upon. Access the required resources through the context object provided to the wrapped function.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_resource_dep_example endbefore=end_resource_dep_example
@resource
def foo_resource(_):
    return "foo"


@resource(required_resource_keys={"foo"})
def emit_foo(init_context):
    return init_context.resources.foo
```

Note that the required keys provided must be provided to the same mode as the requiring resource, and that dependencies between resources cannot be cyclic.

```python file=/concepts/modes_resources/modes_resources.py startafter=start_resource_dep_mode endbefore=end_resource_dep_mode
ModeDefinition(resource_defs={"foo": foo_resource, "emit": emit_foo})
```

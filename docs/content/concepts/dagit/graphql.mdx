# GraphQL API

Dagster exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to interact with Dagster programmatically. The API allows users to:

- Query information about pipeline runs (both historical and currently executing)
- Retrieve metadata about repositories, pipelines, and solids (such as pipeline structure and config schemas)
- Launch pipeline executions and re-executions, allowing users to trigger pipeline executions on custom events

## Note about breaking changes

The GraphQL API is still evolving and is subject to breaking changes. A large portion of the API is primarily for internal use by Dagit. For any of the queries below, we will be clear about breaking changes in release notes.

## Using the GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is served alongside the Dagit web server. To start the server, run `dagit` in your Dagster workspace.

    dagit

Dagit serves the GraphQL endpoint at the `/graphql` endpoint. If you are running Dagit locally on port 3000, you can access the API at `localhost:3000/graphql`

### Using the GraphQL Playground

You can access the GraphQL Playground by navigating to the `/graphql` route in your browser. The GraphQL Playground contains the full GraphQL Schema and an interactive playground to write and test queries and mutations.

### Exploring the GraphQL Schema and Documentation

Clicking on the `Docs` tab on the right edge of the playground opens up interactive documentation for the GraphQL API. The interactive documentation is the best way to explore the API and get information about which fields are available on the queries and mutations.

## Example Queries

### Get a list of pipelines runs

To retrieve a list of all pipeline runs, use the `pipelineRunsOrError` query.

    query PaginatedPipelineRuns {
      pipelineRunsOrError {
        __typename
        ... on PipelineRuns {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Pagination

You may eventually accumulate too many runs to return in one query. The `pipelineRunsOrError` query takes in optional `cursor` and `limit` arguments for pagination:

    query PaginatedPipelineRuns {
      pipelineRunsOrError(
        cursor: "7fd2e5ef-5591-43db-be15-1ebbbbed8bb5"
        limit: 10
      ) {
        __typename
        ... on PipelineRuns {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Filters

The `pipelineRunsOrError` query also takes in an optional filter argument, of type `PipelineRunsFilter`. This query allows you to filter runs by:

- run ID
- pipeline name
- tags
- statuses

For example, the following query will return all failed runs:

    query FilteredPipelineRuns {
      pipelineRunsOrError(filter: { status: FAILURE }) {
        __typename
        ... on PipelineRuns {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Get a list of repositories

This query returns the names and location names of all the repositories currently loaded.

    query RepositoriesQuery {
      repositoriesOrError {
        ... on RepositoryConnection {
          nodes {
            name
            location {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Get a list of pipelines within a repository:

Given a repository, this query returns the names of all the pipelines in the repository.

This query takes a `selector`, which is of type `RepositorySelector`. A repository selector consists of both the repository location name and repository name.

    query PipelinesQuery(
      $repositoryLocationName: String!
      $repositoryName: String!
    ) {
      repositoryOrError(
        repositorySelector: {
          repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
          repositoryName: $repositoryName
        }
      ) {
        ... on Repository {
          pipelines {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Launch a pipeline run

To execute a pipeline, we can use the `launchPipelineExecution` mutation. Here, we define `ExecutePipeline` to wrap our mutation and allow us to pass in the required arguments as query variables.

For this query, the required arguments are:

`selector`:

- This is of type `PipelineSelector`, and consists of the repository location name, repository name, and pipeline name
- You can also add a `solidSelection` argument here, to execute a subset of the pipeline

`runConfigData`:

- This is where you define the run config to execute the pipeline with
- Note that `runConfigData` is of type `RunConfigData`. This type is used when passing in an arbitrary object for run config. This is any-typed in the GraphQL type system but must conform to the constraints of the config schema for this pipeline. If it does not, the mutation returns a `PipelineConfigValidationInvalid` response

`mode`:

- The mode to run the pipeline with.
- If you have not defined any custom modes for your pipeline, the default mode is `default`

<!---->

    mutation ExecutePipeline(
      $repositoryLocationName: String!
      $repositoryName: String!
      $pipelineName: String!
      $runConfigData: RunConfigData!
      $mode: String!
    ) {
      launchPipelineExecution(
        executionParams: {
          selector: {
            repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
            repositoryName: $repositoryName
            pipelineName: $pipelineName
          }
          runConfigData: $runConfigData
          mode: $mode
        }
      ) {
        __typename
        ... on LaunchPipelineRunSuccess {
          run {
            runId
          }
        }
        ... on PipelineConfigValidationInvalid {
          errors {
            message
            reason
          }
        }
        ... on PythonError {
          message
        }
      }
    }

### Launch a pipeline run with preset

If you want to use a preset instead of defining the run config, use the `preset` argument instead.:

    mutation ExecutePipeline(
      $repositoryLocationName: String!
      $repositoryName: String!
      $pipelineName: String!
      $presetName: String!
    ) {
      launchPipelineExecution(
        executionParams: {
          selector: {
            repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
            repositoryName: $repositoryName
            pipelineName: $pipelineName
          }
          preset: $presetName
        }
      ) {
        __typename
        ... on LaunchPipelineRunSuccess {
          run {
            runId
          }
        }
      }
    }

# Dagit UI

Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect solid and pipeline definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

To launch the Dagit web server, run `dagit`. The command will print out the URL you can access the interface from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

Dagit fetches definitions - pipelines, solids, schedules, partition sets - from a set of repositories configured in `workspace.yaml`. It fetches runs and assets from storage, configured in an instance's `dagster.yaml`.

These are the main pages inside Dagit:

## Pipeline

The Pipeline page offers tools to explore a pipeline definition and launch runs for that pipeline.

<!-- Notes: all screenshots are from go/dev -->

### Pipeline definition

The Definition tab shows the topology of solids that make up a pipeline. Selecting a solid reveals detailed metadata about it in the pane to the right.

### Playground

The Playground tab provides a code editor to let you experiment with configuration and launch runs. You can select from the set of presets for the pipeline, or provide custom configuration in the editor.

### Runs

The Runs tab shows the list of recent runs for the pipeline.

## Solid

The Solid page provides detailed information about a solid definition.

_probably needs a new screentshot?_

## Runs

The Runs page lists all pipeline runs. You can filter the list by pipeline name, run ID, execution status, or pipeline tag. Click a run ID to view details for that run.

### Viewing a single run

The Run page provides details for a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each solid took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during the course of execution. Click the "Launch Re-execution" button to kick off a new run with the same configuration as the displayed run.

## Assets

The Assets page lists all assets. You can filter the list by asset key.

### Asset

The Asset page lists details about a single asset.

_would be good to have a screenshot with a nicer graph_

## Schedules

The Schedules page lists all schedules defined in your workspace, as well as information about upcoming ticks for anticipated scheduled runs.

### Schedule

The Schedule page includes details about a single schedule, its recent tick history, and recent runs.

## Status

The Instance status page includes information about the status of the repositories in your workspace, daemon health,
schedules, sensors, and configuration details.

# Python Logging

Dagster is compatible and configurable with [Python's logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html). At the moment, you can access the configuration options through your `dagster.yaml` file, which will apply the contained settings to any run launched from your instance. These settings include which python loggers you'd like to capture from, what log level to set your loggers to, and which handlers / formatters you'd like to use to process log messages produced from your runs.

## Capturing Python Logs <Experimental />

By default, logs generated using the python logging module are not captured into the Dagster ecosystem. This means that they are not stored in the Dagster event log, will not be associated with any Dagster metadata (such as step key, run id, etc.), and will not show up in the default view of Dagit.

For example, imagine you have the following code:

```python file=/concepts/logging/python_logger.py startafter=start_python_logger endbefore=end_python_logger dedent=4
import logging
from dagster import solid

my_logger = logging.getLogger("my_logger")

@solid
def ambitious_solid():

    try:
        x = 1 / 0
        return x
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        my_logger.error("Couldn't divide by zero!")

    return None
```

With the default behavior, because this code uses a custom python logger (instead of `context.log`), this log statement will not be added as an event in the Dagster event log, and therefore won't show up in Dagit. However, sometimes it is desirable to change this default behavior, and treat these sorts of log statements identically to how Dagster treats `context.log` calls.

This can be accomplished by setting the `managed_python_loggers` key in your dagster.yaml file to a list of python logger names that you would like to capture:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_managed_loggers_config2.yaml
python_logs:
  managed_python_loggers:
    - my_logger
    - my_other_logger
```

If you would like to capture logs from ALL python loggers, you can simply include `root` in your list, as python loggers are arranged in a hierarchy, with `root` as the parent of all other loggers:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_managed_loggers_config.yaml
python_logs:
  managed_python_loggers:
    - root
```

Once this key is set, Dagster will treat any normal python log call from one of the listed loggers in the exact same way as a `context.log` call, which means you should be able to see this log statement in Dagit:

Note: if a `python_log_level` is set (see: [Configuring A Python Log Level](#configuring-a-python-log-level)), then the loggers listed here will be set to the given level before a run is launched.

## Configuring A Python Log Level <Experimental />

If you want to set a global log level for your Dagster instance, you can do this by setting the `python_log_level` in your dagster.yaml file. This will set the log level of all loggers managed by Dagster. By default, this will just be the `context.log` logger. If there are custom python loggers that you wish to capture, see [Capturing Python Logs](#capturing-python-logs).

This allows you to filter out logs below a given level. For example, setting a log level of `INFO` will filter out all `DEBUG` level logs.

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_python_log_level_config.yaml
python_logs:
  python_log_level: INFO
```

## Configuring Python Log Handlers <Experimental />

In your dagster.yaml file, you can configure handlers and formatters that will apply to the Dagster instance, so all pipeline runs will share the same logging configuration.

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_handler_config.yaml
python_logs:
  dagster_handler_config:
    handlers:
      myHandler:
        class: logging.StreamHandler
        level: INFO
        stream: ext://sys.stdout
        formatter: myFormatter
    formatters:
      myFormatter:
        format: "My formatted message: %(message)s"
```

Handler and formatter configuration follows the [dictionary config schema format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging-config-dictschema) in the Python logging module. Only the `handlers` and `formatters` dictionary keys will be accepted, as Dagster creates loggers internally.

From there, standard `context.log` calls will output with your configured handlers and formatters.

### Example: Outputting Dagster Logs to a File

Suppose we'd like to output all of our Dagster logs to a file. We can use the Python logging module's built-in [`logging.FileHandler`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.FileHandler) class to send log output to a disk file. We format our config YAML file by defining a new handler `myHandler` to be a `logging.FileHandler` object.

Optionally, we can configure a formatter to apply a custom format to our logs. Since we'd like our logs to appear with a timestamp, we define a custom formatter named `timeFormatter`, attaching it to `myHandler`.

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/python_logging_file_output_config.yaml
python_logs:
  dagster_handler_config:
    handlers:
      myHandler:
        class: logging.FileHandler
        level: INFO
        filename: "my_dagster_logs.log"
        mode: "a"
        formatter: timeFormatter
    formatters:
      timeFormatter:
        format: "%(asctime)s :: %(message)s"
```

Then, we execute the following pipeline:

```python file=/concepts/logging/file_output_pipeline.py startafter=start_custom_file_output_log endbefore=end_custom_file_output_log
@solid
def file_log_solid(context):
    context.log.info("Hello world!")


@pipeline
def file_log_pipeline():
    file_log_solid()
```

After execution, we can read the output log file `my_dagster_logs.log`. As expected, the log file contains the formatted log!

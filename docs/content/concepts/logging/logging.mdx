# Loggers

Dagster includes a rich and extensible logging system. Dagster comes with a built-in logger that
tracks all the execution events. You can also customize loggers to meet your own needs.

## Overview

Loggers are pipeline-scoped logging handlers, which will be automatically invoked whenever solids
in a pipeline log messages.

## Defining a Logger

By default, Dagster comes with a built-in logger that tracks all the execution events. You can find
an example in the [Using Built-in Loggers](#using-built-in-loggers) section.

The built-in Loggers are defined internally using the <PyObject object="LoggerDefinition" /> class.
The <PyObject object="logger" decorator /> decorator exposes a simpler API for the common logging
use case. It is typically what you'll use to define your own loggers. The decorated function should
take a single argument, the `init_context` available during logger initialization, and return a
`logging.Logger`. You can find an example in the [Customizing Loggers](#customizing-loggers) section.

## Using a Logger

### Logging from a Solid

Any solid can emit log messages at any point in its computation:

```python file=/concepts/logging/builtin_logger.py startafter=start_builtin_logger_marker_0 endbefore=end_builtin_logger_marker_0
@solid
def hello_logs(context):
    context.log.info("Hello, world!")


@pipeline
def demo_pipeline():
    hello_logs()
```

### Using Built-in Loggers

When you run the above pipeline in terminal, you'll find the messages have been logged through a built-in
logger.

The `context` object passed to every solid execution includes the built-in log manager, `context.log`.
It exposes the usual `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical` methods you would expect
anywhere else in Python.

When you run Dagster pipelines in Dagit, you'll notice that log messages are visible as colored
messages in the console:

Logs also stream back to the Dagit frontend in real time:

Dagit exposes a powerful facility for filtering log messages based on execution steps and log levels.

### Debugging with Logs

What happens if we introduce an error into our solid logic?

```python file=/concepts/logging/builtin_logger.py startafter=start_builtin_logger_error_marker_0 endbefore=end_builtin_logger_error_marker_0
@solid
def hello_logs_error(context):
    raise Exception("Somebody set up us the bomb")


@pipeline
def demo_pipeline_error():
    hello_logs_error()
```

Errors in user code are caught by the Dagster machinery to ensure pipelines gracefully halt or
continue to execute, but messages including the original stack trace get logged both to the console
and back to Dagit.

Messages at level `ERROR` or above are highlighted both in Dagit and in the console logs, so
we can easily pick them out of logs even without filtering.

In many cases, especially for local development, this log viewer, coupled with solid reexecution,
is sufficient to enable a fast debug cycle for data pipelines.

## Examples

### Configuring the built-in loggers

Suppose that we've gotten the kinks out of our pipelines developing locally, and now we want to run
in productionâ€”without all of the log spew from `DEBUG` messages that was helpful during development.

Just like solids, loggers can be configured when you run a pipeline. For example, to filter all
messages below `ERROR` out of the colored console logger, add the following snippet to your config
YAML:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/config.yaml
loggers:
  console:
    config:
      log_level: ERROR
```

So when you execute the pipeline with that config, you'll only see the ERROR level logs.

### Customizing Loggers

You may find yourself wanting to add or supplement the built-in loggers so that Dagster logs
are integrated with the rest of your log aggregation and monitoring infrastructure.

For example, you may be operating in a containerized environment where container stdout is
aggregated by a tool such as Logstash. In this kind of environment, where logs will be aggregated
and parsed by machine, the multi-line output from the default colored console logger is unhelpful.
Instead, we'd much prefer to see single-line, structured log messages like:

```json
{"orig_message": "Hello, world!", "log_message_id": "49854579-e4d1-4289-8453-b3e177b20056", ...}
```

In fact, a logger that prints JSON-formatted single-line messages like this to the console is
already included as `dagster.loggers.json_console_logger`. But let's look at how we might
implement a simplified version of this logger.

Loggers are defined internally using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="LoggerDefinition" displayText="LoggerDefinition" />
class, but, following a common pattern in the Dagster codebase, the <PyObject module="dagster" object="logger" displayText="@logger" />
decorator exposes a simpler API for the common use case and
is typically what you'll use to define your own loggers. The decorated function should take a single
argument, the `init_context` available during logger initialization, and return a `logging.Logger`.

```python file=/concepts/logging/custom_logger.py startafter=start_custom_logger_marker_0 endbefore=end_custom_logger_marker_0
@logger(
    {
        "log_level": Field(str, is_required=False, default_value="INFO"),
        "name": Field(str, is_required=False, default_value="dagster"),
    },
    description="A JSON-formatted console logger",
)
def json_console_logger(init_context):
    level = init_context.logger_config["log_level"]
    name = init_context.logger_config["name"]

    klass = logging.getLoggerClass()
    logger_ = klass(name, level=level)

    handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    class JsonFormatter(logging.Formatter):
        def format(self, record):
            return json.dumps(record.__dict__)

    handler.setFormatter(JsonFormatter())
    logger_.addHandler(handler)

    return logger_


@solid
def hello_logs(context):
    context.log.info("Hello, world!")


@pipeline(mode_defs=[ModeDefinition(logger_defs={"my_json_logger": json_console_logger})])
def demo_pipeline():
    hello_logs()
```

As you can see, you can specify the logger name in the run config. It also takes a `config` argument,
representing the config that users can pass to the logger, for example:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/config_custom_logger.yaml
loggers:
  my_json_logger:
    config:
      log_level: INFO
```

When you execute the pipeline, you'll notice that you are no longer using the built-in logger but
your custom json logger instead.

## Patterns

### <Check/> Environment-specific logging using modes

Logging is environment-specific: you don't want messages generated by data scientists' local
development loops to be aggregated with production messages; on the other hand, you may find that
in production console logging is irrelevant or even counterproductive.

Dagster recognizes this by attaching loggers to [modes](/concepts/modes/modes) so that you can
seamlessly switch from, e.g., Cloudwatch logging in production to console logging in development
and test, without changing any of your code.

```python file=/concepts/logging/logging_modes.py startafter=start_logging_mode_marker_0 endbefore=end_logging_mode_marker_0
@solid
def hello_logs(context):
    context.log.info("Hello, world!")


@pipeline(
    mode_defs=[
        ModeDefinition(name="local", logger_defs={"console": colored_console_logger}),
        ModeDefinition(name="prod", logger_defs={"cloudwatch": cloudwatch_logger}),
    ]
)
def hello_modes():
    hello_logs()
```

From Dagit, you can switch your pipeline mode to 'prod' and edit config in order to use the new
Cloudwatch logger, for example:

```yaml file=/concepts/logging/config_modes.yaml
loggers:
  cloudwatch:
    config:
      log_level: ERROR
      log_group_name: /my/cool/cloudwatch/log/group
      log_stream_name: very_good_log_stream
```

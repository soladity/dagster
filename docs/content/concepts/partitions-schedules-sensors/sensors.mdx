## Overview

Sensors are definitions in Dagster that allow you to instigate runs based on some external state change automatically. For example, you can:

- Launch a run whenever a file appears in an s3 bucket
- Launch a run whenever another pipeline materializes a specific asset
- Launch a run whenever an external system is down

Sensors have several important properties:

- Each sensor targets a specific pipeline
- A sensor optionally defines tags, a mode, and a solid selection for the targeted pipeline.
- A sensor defines an evaluation function that returns either:
  - One or more <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> objects. Each run request launches a run.
  - An optional <PyObject object="SkipReason"/>, which specifies a message which describes why no runs were requested.

The [Dagster Daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) runs each sensor evaluation function on a tight loop. If you are using sensors, make sure to follow the instructions on the [DagsterDaemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) page to run your sensors.

## Defining a sensor

To define a sensor, use the <PyObject object="sensor" decorator /> decorator. The decorated function is called the `execution_fn` and can optionally have a `context` as the first argument. The context is a <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext" />.

Let's say you have a pipeline that logs a filename that is specified in the solid configuration of the `process_file` solid:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_sensor_pipeline_marker
from dagster import solid, pipeline


@solid(config_schema={"filename": str})
def process_file(context):
    filename = context.solid_config["filename"]
    context.log.info(filename)


@pipeline
def log_file_pipeline():
    process_file()
```

You can write a sensor that watches for new files in a specific directory and `yields` a `RunRequest` for each new file in the directory. By default, this sensor every 30 seconds.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_directory_sensor_marker endbefore=end_directory_sensor_marker
import os
from dagster import sensor, RunRequest


@sensor(pipeline_name="log_file_pipeline")
def my_directory_sensor():
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            yield RunRequest(
                run_key=filename,
                run_config={"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}},
            )
```

This sensor iterates through all the files in `MY_DIRECTORY` and `yields` a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> for each file.

Once `my_directory_sensor` is added to a <PyObject object="repository"/> with `log_file_pipeline`, it can be enabled and used.

## Idempotence and Cursors

When instigating runs based on external events, you usually want to run exactly one pipeline run for each event. There are two ways to define your sensors to avoid creating duplicate runs for your events: using `run_key` and using a cursor.

### Idempotence using run keys

In the example sensor above, the <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> is constructed with a `run_key`.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_run_request_marker endbefore=end_run_request_marker
yield RunRequest(
        run_key=filename,
        run_config={"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}},
    )
```

Dagster guarantees that for a given sensor, at most one run is created for each <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> with a unique `run_key`. If a sensor yields a new run request with a previously used `run_key`, Dagster skips processing the new run request.

In the example, a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> is requested for each file during _every_ sensor evaluation. Therefore, for a given sensor evaluation, there already exists a `RunRequest` with a `run_key` for any file that existed during the previous sensor evaluation. Dagster skips processing duplicate run requests, so Dagster launches runs for only the files added since the last sensor evaluation. The result is exactly one run per file.

Run keys allow you to write sensor evaluation functions that declaratively describe what pipeline runs should exist, and helps you avoid the need for more complex logic that manages state. However, when dealing with high-volume external events, some state-tracking optimizations might be necessary.

### Sensor optimizations using cursors

When writing a sensor that deals with high-volume events, it might not be feasible to `yield` a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> during every sensor evaluation. For example, you may have an `s3` storage bucket that contains thousands of files.

When writing a sensor for such event sources, you can maintain a cursor that limits the number of yielded run requests for previously processed events. The sensor context, provided to every sensor evaluation function, has a `cursor` property and a `update_cursor` method for sensors to track state across evaluations.

- `cursor`: A cursor field on <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext"/> that returns the last persisted cursor value from a previous evaluation.
- `update_cursor`: A method on <PyObject object="SensorEvaluationContext"/> that takes a string to persist and make available to future evaluations.

Here is a somewhat contrived example of our directory file sensor using a cursor for updated files.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_cursor_sensors_marker endbefore=end_cursor_sensors_marker
@sensor(pipeline_name="log_file_pipeline")
def my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
    last_mtime = float(context.cursor) if context.cursor else 0

    max_mtime = last_mtime
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            fstats = os.stat(filepath)
            file_mtime = fstats.st_mtime
            if file_mtime <= last_mtime:
                continue

            # the run key should include mtime if we want to kick off new runs based on file modifications
            run_key = f"{filename}:{str(file_mtime)}"
            run_config = {"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}}
            yield RunRequest(run_key=run_key, run_config=run_config)
            max_mtime = max(max_mtime, file_mtime)

    context.update_cursor(str(max_mtime))
```

For sensors that consume multiple event streams, you may need to serialize and deserialize a more complex data structure in and out of the cursor string to keep track of the sensor's progress over the multiple streams.

## Evaluation Interval

By default, the Dagster Daemon runs a sensor 30 seconds after the previous sensor evaluation finishes executing. You can configure the interval using the `minimum_interval_seconds` argument on the <PyObject object="sensor" decorator/> decorator.

It's important to note that this interval represents a minimum interval _between_ runs of the sensor and not the exact frequency the sensor runs. If you have a sensor that takes 2 minutes to complete, but the `minimum_interval_seconds` is 5 seconds, the fastest Dagster Daemon will run the sensor is every 2 minutes and 5 seconds. The `minimum_interval_seconds` only guarantees that the sensor is not evaluated more frequently than the given interval.

For example, here are two sensors that specify two different minimum intervals:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_interval_sensors_maker endbefore=end_interval_sensors_maker
@sensor(pipeline_name="my_pipeline", minimum_interval_seconds=30)
def sensor_A():
    yield RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config={})


@sensor(pipeline_name="my_pipeline", minimum_interval_seconds=45)
def sensor_B():
    yield RunRequest(run_key=None, run_config={})
```

These sensor definitions are short, so they run in less than a second. Therefore, you can expect these sensors to run consistently around every 30 and 45 seconds, respectively.

## Skipping sensor evaluations

For debugging purposes, it is often useful to describe why a sensor might not yield any runs for a given evaluation. The sensor evaluation function can yield a <PyObject object="SkipReason" /> with a string description that will be displayed in Dagit.

For example, here is our directory sensor that now provides a SkipReason when no files are encountered:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_skip_sensors_marker endbefore=end_skip_sensors_marker
@sensor(pipeline_name="log_file_pipeline")
def my_directory_sensor_with_skip_reasons():
    has_files = False
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            yield RunRequest(
                run_key=filename,
                run_config={"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}},
            )
            has_files = True
    if not has_files:
        yield SkipReason(f"No files found in {MY_DIRECTORY}.")
```

## Testing sensors

To quickly preview what an existing sensor would generate when evaluated, you can run the CLI command `dagster sensor preview my_sensor_name`.

In order to unit test sensors, you can invoke the sensor directly. This will return all the run requests yielded by the sensor. The config obtained from these can be validated using the <PyObject object="validate_run_config" /> function.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_testing endbefore=end_sensor_testing
from dagster import validate_run_config


@sensor(pipeline_name="log_file_pipeline")
def sensor_to_test():
    yield RunRequest(
        run_key="foo",
        run_config={"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": "foo"}}}},
    )


def test_sensor():
    for run_request in sensor_to_test():
        assert validate_run_config(log_file_pipeline, run_request.run_config)
```

Notice that since we did not use the context argument in our sensor, we don't have to provide a context object. However, if we do in fact need the context object for our sensor, we can provide it via <PyObject object="build_sensor_context" />. Consider again the `my_directory_sensor_cursor` example.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_cursor_sensors_marker endbefore=end_cursor_sensors_marker
@sensor(pipeline_name="log_file_pipeline")
def my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
    last_mtime = float(context.cursor) if context.cursor else 0

    max_mtime = last_mtime
    for filename in os.listdir(MY_DIRECTORY):
        filepath = os.path.join(MY_DIRECTORY, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(filepath):
            fstats = os.stat(filepath)
            file_mtime = fstats.st_mtime
            if file_mtime <= last_mtime:
                continue

            # the run key should include mtime if we want to kick off new runs based on file modifications
            run_key = f"{filename}:{str(file_mtime)}"
            run_config = {"solids": {"process_file": {"config": {"filename": filename}}}}
            yield RunRequest(run_key=run_key, run_config=run_config)
            max_mtime = max(max_mtime, file_mtime)

    context.update_cursor(str(max_mtime))
```

This sensor makes use of the `context` argument, and thus to invoke it, we need to provide one.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_sensor_testing_with_context endbefore=end_sensor_testing_with_context
from dagster import build_sensor_context


def test_my_directory_sensor_cursor():
    context = build_sensor_context(cursor="0")
    for run_request in my_directory_sensor_cursor(context):
        assert validate_run_config(log_file_pipeline, run_request.run_config)
```

## Monitoring sensors in Dagit

<!--
    These images were generated by running

    ```
    cd dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/
    dagit -f sensors.py
    ```
 -->

You can monitor and operate sensors in Dagit. There are multiple views that help with observing sensor evaluations, skip reasons, and errors.

To view the sensors page, click the "All sensors" in the left-hand navigation pane. Here you can turn sensors on and off using the toggle.

<Image
alt="All Sensors"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors/all-sensors.png"
width={1982}
height={1400}
/>

If you click on any sensor, you can monitor all sensor evaluations and runs created:

<Image
alt="Sensor A"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors/sensor-A.png"
width={1982}
height={1400}
/>

If your sensor throws an error or yields a skip reason, the sensor timeline view will display more information about the errors and skips:

<Image
alt="My Directory Sensor"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors/my-directory-sensor.png"
width={1938}
height={1356}
/>

## Asset sensors

A useful pattern is to create a sensor that checks for new <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events for a particular asset key. This can be used to kick off a pipeline that computes downstream assets or notifies appropriate stakeholders.

One benefit of this pattern is that it enables cross-pipeline and even cross-repository dependencies. Each pipeline run instigated by an asset sensor is agnostic to the pipeline event that caused it.

Dagster provides a special asset sensor definition format for sensors that fire a single RunRequest based on a single asset materialization. Here is an example of a sensor that generates a RunRequest for every materialization for the asset key `my_table`:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_asset_sensor_marker
from dagster import AssetKey, asset_sensor


@asset_sensor(asset_key=AssetKey("my_table"), pipeline_name="my_pipeline")
def my_asset_sensor(context, asset_event):
    yield RunRequest(
        run_key=context.cursor,
        run_config={
            "solids": {
                "read_materialization": {
                    "config": {
                        "asset_key": asset_event.asset_key.path,
                        "pipeline": asset_event.pipeline_name,
                    }
                }
            }
        },
    )
```

### Multi-asset sensors

Multi-asset sensors, which can trigger pipeline executions based on some combination of states from multiple asset materialization event streams, can be handled using the base sensor definition and manual cursor management based on the asset event streams. These asset event streams can be queried using the `instance` attribute off of the <PyObject object="SensorExecutionContext" /> object.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_marker
import json
from dagster import EventRecordsFilter, DagsterEventType


@sensor(pipeline_name="my_pipeline")
def multi_asset_sensor(context):
    cursor_dict = json.loads(context.cursor) if context.cursor else {}
    a_cursor = cursor_dict.get("a")
    b_cursor = cursor_dict.get("b")

    a_event_records = context.instance.get_event_records(
        EventRecordsFilter(
            event_type=DagsterEventType.ASSET_MATERIALIZATION,
            asset_key=AssetKey("table_a"),
            after_cursor=a_cursor,
        ),
        ascending=False,
        limit=1,
    )
    b_event_records = context.instance.get_event_records(
        EventRecordsFilter(
            event_type=DagsterEventType.ASSET_MATERIALIZATION,
            asset_key=AssetKey("table_a"),
            after_cursor=b_cursor,
        ),
        ascending=False,
        limit=1,
    )

    if not a_event_records or not b_event_records:
        return

    # make sure we only generate events if both table_a and table_b have been materialized since
    # the last evaluation.
    yield RunRequest(run_key=None)

    # update the sensor cursor by combining the individual event cursors from the two separate
    # asset event streams
    context.update_cursor(
        json.dumps(
            {
                "a": a_event_records[0].storage_id,
                "b": b_event_records[0].storage_id,
            }
        )
    )
```

## Run status sensors

If you want to act on the status of a pipeline run, Dagster provides a way to create a sensor that reacts to run statuses. You can use <PyObject object="run_status_sensor" /> with a specified <PyObject object="PipelineRunStatus" /> to decorate a function that will run when the given status occurs. This can be used to send alerts to a monitoring service on pipeline failure or report a run success.

Here is an example of a sensor that reports pipeline success:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_success_sensor_marker endbefore=end_success_sensor_marker
from dagster import run_status_sensor, RunStatusSensorContext, PipelineRunStatus


@run_status_sensor(pipeline_run_status=PipelineRunStatus.SUCCESS)
def my_slack_on_pipeline_success(context: RunStatusSensorContext):
    slack_client = WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_DAGSTER_ETL_BOT_TOKEN"])

    slack_client.chat_postMessage(
        channel="#alert-channel",
        message=f'Pipeline "{context.pipeline_run.pipeline_name}" succeeded.',
    )
```

Then, you can add the sensor to a repository so it can be enabled and used the same as other sensors:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_repo_marker endbefore=end_repo_marker
from dagster import repository


@repository
def my_repository():
    return my_pipelines + [my_slack_on_pipeline_success]
```

### Pipeline failure sensor

Dagster provides a set of special run status sensor decorators for defining sensors that monitor pipeline failure events. You can use <PyObject object="pipeline_failure_sensor" /> to decorate a function that will run when a pipeline run fails.

For example, you can write a sensor that sends a slack message when it runs using this decorator:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_alert_sensor_marker endbefore=end_alert_sensor_marker
import os
from dagster import pipeline_failure_sensor, PipelineFailureSensorContext
from slack import WebClient


@pipeline_failure_sensor
def my_slack_on_pipeline_failure(context: PipelineFailureSensorContext):
    slack_client = WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_DAGSTER_ETL_BOT_TOKEN"])

    slack_client.chat_postMessage(
        channel="#alert-channel",
        message=f'Pipeline "{context.pipeline_run.pipeline_name}" failed. Error: {context.failure_event.message}',
    )
```

**Dagster also provides the following out-of-box pipeline failure sensors:**

<PyObject
module="dagster_slack"
object="make_slack_on_pipeline_failure_sensor"
/> helps you create a pipeline failure sensor that will message a given Slack channel:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_slack_marker endbefore=end_slack_marker
from dagster_slack import make_slack_on_pipeline_failure_sensor

slack_on_pipeline_failure = make_slack_on_pipeline_failure_sensor(
    "#my_channel", os.getenv("MY_SLACK_TOKEN")
)
```

<PyObject
module="dagster.utils"
object="make_email_on_pipeline_failure_sensor"
/> helps you create a pipeline failure sensor that will send emails via the SMTP
protocol:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensor_alert.py startafter=start_email_marker endbefore=end_email_marker
from dagster.utils import make_email_on_pipeline_failure_sensor


email_on_pipeline_failure = make_email_on_pipeline_failure_sensor(
    email_from="no-reply@example.com",
    email_password=os.getenv("ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD"),
    email_to=["xxx@example.com", "xyz@example.com"],
)
```

Besides, if you would like to set up success or failure handling policies on solids, you can find more information on the [Solid Hooks](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solid-hooks) page.

## Examples

### S3 sensors

For pipelines that should initiate new runs for new paths in an s3 bucket, the `dagster-aws` package provides the useful helper function `get_s3_keys`.

Here is an example of a sensor that listens to a particular s3 bucket `my_s3_bucket`:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/sensors.py startafter=start_s3_sensors_marker endbefore=end_s3_sensors_marker
from dagster_aws.s3.sensor import get_s3_keys


@sensor(pipeline_name="my_pipeline")
def my_s3_sensor(context):
    new_s3_keys = get_s3_keys("my_s3_bucket", since_key=context.last_run_key)
    if not new_s3_keys:
        yield SkipReason("No new s3 files found for bucket my_s3_bucket.")
        return
    for s3_key in new_s3_keys:
        yield RunRequest(run_key=s3_key, run_config={})
```

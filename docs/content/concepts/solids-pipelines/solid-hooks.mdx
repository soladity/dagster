## Overview

A <PyObject module="dagster" object="success_hook" displayText="@success_hook" /> or <PyObject module="dagster" object="failure_hook" displayText="@failure_hook" /> decorated function is called a solid hook. Solid hooks are designed for generic purposes â€” it can be anything you would like to do at a per solid level.

## Defining a Solid Hook

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_repo_marker_0 endbefore=end_repo_marker_0
from dagster import HookContext, failure_hook, success_hook


@success_hook(required_resource_keys={"slack"})
def slack_message_on_success(context: HookContext):
    message = f"Solid {context.solid.name} finished successfully"
    context.resources.slack.chat.post_message(channel="#foo", text=message)


@failure_hook(required_resource_keys={"slack"})
def slack_message_on_failure(context: HookContext):
    message = f"Solid {context.solid.name} failed"
    context.resources.slack.chat.post_message(channel="#foo", text=message)
```

### Hook context

As you may have noticed, the hook function takes one argument, which is an instance of <PyObject module="dagster" object="HookContext" />. The available properties on this context are:

- `context.log`: loggers
- `context.solid`: the solid associated with the hook.
- `context.solid_config`: The config specific to the associated solid.
- `context.step`: the execution step that triggers the hook.
- `context.resources`: the resources the hook can use.

## Using Hooks

Dagster provides different ways to trigger solid hooks.

### Applying a hook on every solid in a pipeline

For example, you want to send a slack message to a channel when any solid fails in a pipeline. In this case, we will be applying a hook on a pipeline, which will apply the hook on every solid instance within in that pipeline.

You can simply use the hook created "slack_message_on_failure" above to decorate the pipeline "notif_all". Then, slack messages will be sent when any solid in the pipeline fails.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_repo_marker_1 endbefore=end_repo_marker_1
@slack_message_on_failure
@pipeline(mode_defs=mode_defs)
def notif_all():
    # the hook "slack_message_on_failure" is applied on every solid instance within this pipeline
    a()
    b()
```

### Applying a hook on a solid

However, sometimes a pipeline is a shared responsibility or you only want to be alerted on high-priority solid executions. So we also provide a way to set up hooks on solid instances which enables you to apply policies on a per-solid basis.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_repo_marker_2 endbefore=end_repo_marker_2
@pipeline(mode_defs=mode_defs)
def selective_notif():
    # only solid "a" triggers hooks: a slack message will be sent when it fails or succeeds
    a.with_hooks({slack_message_on_failure, slack_message_on_success})()
    # solid "b" won't trigger any hooks
    b()
```

In this case, solid "b" won't trigger any hooks, while when solid "a" fails or succeeds it will send a slack message.

## (Experimental) Testing Hooks

You can test the functionality of a hook by invoking the hook definition. This will run the underlying decorated function. You can construct a context to provide to the invocation using the <PyObject object="build_hook_context" /> function.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_testing_hooks endbefore=end_testing_hooks
from dagster import build_hook_context


@success_hook(required_resource_keys={"my_conn"})
def my_success_hook(context):
    context.resources.my_conn.send("foo")


def test_my_success_hook():
    my_conn = mock.MagicMock()
    # construct HookContext with mocked ``my_conn`` resource.
    context = build_hook_context(resources={"my_conn": my_conn})

    my_success_hook(context)

    assert my_conn.send.call_count == 1
```

## Examples

### Accessing failure information in a failure hook

In many cases, you might want to know details about a solid failure. You can get the exception object thrown in the failed solid via the `solid_exception` property on <PyObject module="dagster" object="HookContext" />:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks_context.py startafter=start_failure_hook_solid_exception endbefore=end_failure_hook_solid_exception
from dagster import HookContext, failure_hook
import traceback


@failure_hook
def my_failure_hook(context: HookContext):
    solid_exception: BaseException = context.solid_exception
    # print stack trace of exception
    traceback.print_tb(solid_exception.__traceback__)
```

## Patterns

### <Check/> Environment-specific hooks using modes

Hooks use resource keys to access resources. After including the resource key in its set of `required_resource_keys`, the body of the hook can access the corresponding resource via the `resources` attribute of its context object.

It also enables you to switch resource values in different modes so that, for example, you can send slack messages only when you are in "prod" mode and mock the slack resource when you are in "dev" mode.

In this case, we can mock the `slack_resource` in the "dev" mode using a helper function <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" displayText="ResourceDefinition.hardcoded_resource()"/>, so it won't send slack messages when you are developing the pipeline.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_repo_marker_3 endbefore=end_repo_marker_3
mode_defs = [
    ModeDefinition(
        "dev",
        resource_defs={
            "slack": ResourceDefinition.hardcoded_resource(
                slack_resource_mock, "do not send messages in dev"
            )
        },
    ),
    ModeDefinition("prod", resource_defs={"slack": slack_resource}),
]
```

When we switch to "prod" mode, we can provide the real slack token in the `run_config` and therefore enable sending messages to a certain slack channel when a hook is triggered.

```yaml file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/prod_solid_hooks.yaml
resources:
  slack:
    config:
      token: "xoxp-1234123412341234-12341234-1234" # replace with your slack token
```

Then, we can execute a pipeline with the config through Python API, CLI, or the Dagit UI. Here's an example of using the Python API.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solid_hooks.py startafter=start_repo_main endbefore=end_repo_main
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open(
        file_relative_path(__file__, "prod.yaml"),
        "r",
    ) as fd:
        run_config = yaml.safe_load(fd.read())
    result = execute_pipeline(notif_all, run_config=run_config, mode="prod")
```

### <Cross/> Pipeline-level hooks

When you add a hook decorator to a pipeline, the hook will be added to every solid in the pipeline individually. The hook does not track pipeline-scoped events and only tracks solid-level success or failure events.

You may find the need to set up pipeline-level policies. For example, you may want to run some code for every pipeline failure.

Dagster provides a way to create a sensor that reacts to pipeline failure events. You can find details at [Pipeline failure sensor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#pipeline-failure-sensor) on the [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) page.

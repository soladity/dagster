# Execution

Dagster provides several different ways to execute jobs.

## Relevant APIs

| <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" /> | A method to execute a job synchronously, typically for running scripts or testing. |

## Overview

There are several different ways to execute jobs. This page explains different ways to do one-off execution of jobs: [Dagit](#dagit), [Dagster CLI](#dagster-cli), or [Python APIs](#python-apis).

You can also launch jobs in other ways:

- [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) can be used to launch runs on a fixed interval.
- [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) allow you to launch runs based on external state changes.

## Executing a Job

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipeline_execution.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
from dagster import job, op


@op
def return_one():
    return 1


@op
def add_two(i: int):
    return i + 2


@op
def multi_three(i: int):
    return i * 3


@job
def my_job():
    multi_three(add_two(return_one()))
```

### Dagit

Dagster comes with a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with jobs and other Dagster objects.

To view your job in Dagit, you can use the [`dagit`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagit) command:

```bash
dagit -f my_job.py
```

Then navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to start using Dagit:

<Image
alt="pipeline-def"
src="/images/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipeline-def.png"
width={3808}
height={2414}
/>

Click on the "Launchpad" tab, then press the "Launch Run" button to execute the job. You will then see Dagit launch a job run:

<Image
alt="job-run"
src="/images/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipeline-run.png"
width={3808}
height={2414}
/>

By default, Dagit will run the job using the multiprocess executor - that means each step in the job runs in its own process, and steps that don't depend on each other can run in parallel.

Dagit Launchpad also offers a configuration editor to let you interactively build up the configuration. See details in [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit#launchpad).

### Dagster CLI

The dagster CLI includes both [`dagster job execute`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-pipeline-execute) for direct execution and [`dagster job launch`](https://docs.dagster.io/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-pipeline-launch) for launching runs asynchronously using the [run launcher](/deployment/run-launcher) on your instance.

To execute your job directly, you can simply run:

```bash
dagster job execute -f my_job.py
```

### Python APIs

Dagster includes Python APIs for execution that are useful when writing tests or scripts.

<PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" /> executes a job and
returns an <PyObject object="ExecuteInProcessResult" />.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipeline_execution.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = my_job.execute_in_process()
```

You can find the full API documentation in [Execution API](/\_apidocs/execution) and learn more about the testing use cases in [Testing](/concepts/testing).

## Executing Job Subsets

Dagster supports ways to run a subset of a job, called Op Selection.

### Op Selection Syntax

To specify op selection, Dagster supports a simple query syntax.

It works as follows:

- A query includes a list of clauses.
- A clause can be a op name, in which case that op is selected.
- A clause can be a op name preceded by `*`, in which case that op and all of its ancestors (upstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be a op name followed by `*`, in which case that op and all of its descendents (downstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be a op name followed by any number of `+`s, in which case that op and descendents up to that many hops away are selected.
- A clause can be a op name preceded by any number of `+`s, in which case that op and ancestors up to that many hops away are selected.

**Clause examples**

- `some_op`: select "some_op" itself
- `*some_op`: select "some_op" and all ancestors (upstream dependencies).
- `some_op*`: select "some_op" and all descendants (downstream dependencies).
- `*some_op*`: select "some_op" and all of its ancestors and descendants.
- `+some_op`: select "some_op" and its direct parents.
- `some_op+++`: select "some_op" and its children, its children's children, and its children's children's children.

### Specifying Op Selection

You can use this selection syntax in the `op_selection` argument to the <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" />:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/pipeline_execution.py startafter=start_solid_selection_marker endbefore=end_solid_selection_marker
my_job.execute_in_process(op_selection=["*add_two"])
```

Similarly, you can specify the same op selection in Dagit Launchpad:

<Image
alt="op-selection"
src="/images/concepts/solids-pipelines/solid-selection.png"
width={3808}
height={2414}
/>

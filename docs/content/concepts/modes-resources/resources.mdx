# Resources

Resources are used in Dagster to make external resources (like a database connection) available to solids during pipeline execution. When used alongside modes, resources make it easier to write pipelines that can be developed locally and tested.

| <PyObject object="resource" decorator />  | The decorator used to define resources. The decorated function is called a `resource_fn`. The decorator returns a <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" />                                                         |
| <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition"  /> | Base class for solids. You almost never want to use initialize this class directly. Instead, you should use the <PyObject object="resource" decorator /> which returns a <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition"  /> |

## Overview

We recommend learning about [Modes](/concepts/modes-resources/modes) before learning about resources.

Resources ...

## Defining a Resource

To define a resource, we use the <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator:

```python

class DatabaseConnection():
    def execute_query():
        pass

@resource
def db_resource(init_context):
    return DatabaseConnection()
```

The <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator decorates a function that returns a resource. The object returned from the resource function itself can be any standard python object - it doesn't need to inherit any particular interface or implement any particular functionality.

### Resource Configuration

<PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" pluralize /> can have a config schema, which
allows you to customize behavior at runtime through pipeline configuration.

For example, let's say we wanted to pass a connection string to our `DatabaseConnection` resource.

```python
class DatabaseConnection():
    def __init__(connection: str):
        self.connection = connection

@resource(config_schema={"connection": str})
def db_resource(init_context):
    connection = init_context.resource_config["connection"]
    return DatabaseConnection(connection)
```

### Resource to Resource Dependencies

Resources can depend upon other resources. If a resource key is included in the `required_resource_keys` set provided to the resource definition, then the resource initializer can access a required resource via the "resources" attribute of its context object.

# Pipeline Modes

Modes (along with [Resources](/concepts/modes-resources/resources)) provide a way to control the behavior of multiple solids at pipeline execution time.

| <PyObject object="ModeDefinition"  /> | Base class used to define a pipeline mode |

## Overview

For those familiar with dependency injection, modes and resources offer a similar capability, using pythonic idioms and Dagster’s configuration system.

Each pipeline can be defined with multiple modes, but each pipeline run uses exactly one mode. Each mode exposes:

- A set of [Resources](/concepts/modes-resources/resources)
- A [Logger](/concepts/logging/loggers)
- An [Executor](/concepts/executors)

A typical usage for modes is to vary pipeline behavior between different deployment environments. For example, you might define a `local_dev` mode for running pipelines on a laptop against synthetic data and a “prod” mode for running pipelines against production data in the cloud.

Modes affect solid behavior by providing resources to the solids. For example, the `local_dev` mode might reference a `SQLiteDatabase` resource that solids can execute queries against. The `prod` mode might instead reference an `PostgresDatabase` resource.

## Defining a Mode Definition

To define a mode, we use the <PyObject object="ModeDefinition"/> class:

```python
ModeDefinition(name="prod", resources={...}, loggers={...}, executor_defs=[...])
```

### Modes with Resources

In this example, we define two modes that contain a `database` resource:

```python
@pipeline(
    mode_defs=[
        ModeDefinition("local_dev", resource_defs={"database": sqlite_database}),
        ModeDefinition("prod", resource_defs={"database": postgres_database}),
    ],
)
def query_pipeline():
    do_query()
```

We can access the resource by resource name in the solid:

```python
@solid(required_resource_keys={"database"})
def generate_table_1(context):
    context.resources.database.execute_query("create table_1 as select * from table_0")
```

When the pipeline is run with the `local_dev` mode, `context.resources.database` will be an instance of `SqliteDatabase`. When running in `prod` mode, the same resource will be a `PostgresDatabase`

### Modes with Loggers

### Modes with Executors

## Selecting a Mode during execution

### In Dagit

When Launching the pipeline via the Dagit Playground, you can select a mode from the mode selector dropdown:

<TODO />

### Dagster CLI

When launching a pipeline via the CLI, you can use the `-d` option to specify the mode.

    $ dagster pipeline execute -d prod_mode my_pipeline

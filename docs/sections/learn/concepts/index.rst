Concepts
========

As you get started with Dagster, you'll find that there are a number of important concepts
underpinning the system. Some of these concepts, like pipelines (also referred to as DAGs or flows in other systems), will undoubtably be familiar
if you've previously worked with tools like Airflow. However, Dagster has some important differences
from other workflow systems to facilitate operating at a higher level of abstraction.

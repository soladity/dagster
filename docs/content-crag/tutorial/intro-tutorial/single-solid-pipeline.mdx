# A Single-Op Graph

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/" />

## Ops and Graphs

Dagster's core abstractions are **[ops](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids)** and **[graphs](/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipelines)**.

**[Ops](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids)** are individual units of computation that we wire together to form **[graphs](/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipelines)**.

In this section, we'll cover how to define a simple graph with a single op, and then execute it.

## The Cereal Dataset

Our graph will operate on a simple but scary CSV dataset, cereal.csv, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Hello, Op!

Let's write our first Dagster op and save it as `hello_cereal.py`.

A op is a unit of computation in a graph. Typically, you'll define ops by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="op" displayText="@op" /> decorator.

Our first op does three things: downloads a csv of cereal data, reads it into a list of dictionaries which each represent a row in the CSV, and logs the number of rows it finds.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_solid_marker endbefore=end_solid_marker
import requests
import csv
from dagster import graph, op


@op
def hello_cereal(context):
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereals = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]
    context.log.info(f"Found {len(cereals)} cereals")

    return cereals
```

In this simple case, our op takes no arguments except for the <PyObject module="dagster"
object="SolidExecutionContext" displayText="context" /> in which it executes (provided by the Dagster framework as the first argument to solids who specify it), and also returns no outputs. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter solids that are much more dynamic.

## Hello, Graph!

To execute our op, we'll embed it in an equally simple graph. A graph is a set of solids arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation. You'll typically define graphs by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="graph" displayText="@graph" /> decorator.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
@graph
def hello_cereal_graph():
    hello_cereal()
```

Here you'll see that we call `hello_cereal()`. This call doesn't actually execute the op. Within the bodies of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="graph"
displayText="@graph" />, we use function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the solids making up the graph. Here, we indicate that the execution of `hello_cereal` doesn't depend on any other solids by calling it with no arguments.

## Executing Our First Graph

Assuming you’ve saved this graph as `hello_cereal.py`, you can execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your graph (which only has one node) in Dagit, from the directory in which you've saved the graph file, just run:

```bash
dagit -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see output like

```bash
Loading repository... Serving on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000/graph/hello_cereal_pipeline/> in your web browser and view your graph. It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one node.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

Click on the "Playground" tab and you'll see the view below.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

The large upper left pane is empty here, but, in graphs with parameters, this is where you'll be able to edit graph configuration on the fly.

Click the "Launch Execution" button on the bottom right to execute this plan directly from Dagit. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1—or, just navigate to the "Runs" tab to see this, and every run of your graph.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your graph run.

### Dagster CLI

From the directory in which you've saved the graph file, just run:

```bash
dagster graph execute -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by Dagster appear in the console, including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2021-02-05 08:50:25 - dagster - INFO - system - ce5d4576-2569-44ff-a14a-51010eea5329 - hello_cereal - Found 77 cereals
```

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather execute your graphs as a script, you can do that without using the Dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to `hello_cereal.py`

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = hello_cereal_graph.execute_in_process()
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello_cereal.py
```

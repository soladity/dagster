# Testing Ops and Graphs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/" />

Data applications are notoriously difficult to test and are therefore often un- or under-tested.

Creating testable and verifiable data pipelines is one of the focuses of Dagster. We believe ensuring data quality is critical for managing the complexity of data systems. Here, we'll show how to write unit tests for Dagster graphs and ops.

## Testing the Cereal Graph (and its Ops)

Let's go back to the `diamond` graph we wrote in the [prior section](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/connecting-solids#a-more-complex-dag), and ensure that it's working as expected by writing some unit tests.

We'll start by writing a test for the `find_highest_calorie_cereal` op, which takes a set of cereals as input and returns the name of the cereal with the most calories. To run an op, we can invoke it directly, as if it's a regular Python function:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/test_complex_pipeline.py startafter=start_op_test endbefore=end_op_test
No match for endBefore value "end_op_test"
```

We'll also write a test for the entire pipeline. The <PyObject
module="dagster" object="GraphDefinition" method="execute_in_process" /> method synchronously executes a graph and returns a <PyObject module="dagster"
object="PipelineExecutionResult" />, whose methods let us investigate, in detail, the success or failure of execution, the outputs produced by ops, and (as we'll see later) other events associated with execution.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/test_complex_pipeline.py startafter=start_graph_test endbefore=end_graph_test
def test_diamond():
    res = diamond.execute_in_process()
    assert res.success
    highest_protein_cereal = res.result_for_node(
        "find_highest_protein_cereal"
    ).output_value()
    assert highest_protein_cereal == "Special K"
```

Now you can use pytest, or your test runner of choice, to run unit tests as you develop your data applications.

```bash
pytest test_complex_pipeline.py
```

Obviously, in production we'll often execute pipelines in a parallel, streaming way that doesn't admit this kind of API, which is intended to enable local tests like this.

Dagster is written to make testing easy in a domain where it has historically been very difficult. Throughout the rest of this tutorial, we'll explore the writing of unit tests for each piece of the framework as we learn about it. You can learn more about Testing in Dagster by reading the [Testing](/concepts/testing) page.

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Having reached this far, you now have a working, testable, and maintainable data pipeline. You should now be able to build your own data applications using Dagster!

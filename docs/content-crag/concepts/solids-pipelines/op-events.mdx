# Op Events and Exceptions

Within the body of an op, it is possible to communicate with the Dagster framework either by yielding an event, or raising an exception. This page describes these different possibilities and the scenarios in which you might use them.

## Overview

Within the body of an op, the op can yield a stream of structured events, consisting of several different types. These events will be processed by Dagster and recorded in the event log, along with some additional context about the op that emitted it.

It is also possible to raise Dagster-specific exceptions, which will indicate to the framework to halt the op execution entirely and perform some action.

### Event Metadata

Often, it may be useful to attach some arbitrary information to an event or exception that is not captured by its basic parameters. Through the <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> object, we provide a consistent interface for specifying this metadata on a variety of events. Depending on the type of the data, these entries will be rendered in Dagit in a more useful format than a simple unstructured string.

The <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" />, <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" />, and <PyObject object="Failure" /> objects each accept a `metadata` parameter, which maps string labels to structured values. <PyObject object="Output"/> also accepts this parameter, although this functionality is currently experimental may change in the future.

We provide support for a wide variety of potentially useful metadata types, including simple datatypes (`EventMetadataEntry.float`, `EventMetadataEntry.int`, `EventMetadataEntry.text`), as well as more complex information such as markdown and json (`EventMetadataEntry.md`, `EventMetadataEntry.json`).

Check out the API Docs for <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> for more details.

## Events

Yielding events from within the body of an op is a useful way of communicating with the Dagster framework. The most critical event to the functionality of Dagster is the <PyObject object="Output"/> event, which allows output data to be passed on from one op to the next. However, we also provide interfaces to inform Dagster about external assets and data quality checks during the run of an op.

### Outputs

Because returning a value from an op is such a fundamental part of creating a data pipeline, we have a few different interfaces for this functionality, to help ease transition into writing Dagster-specific code.

For ops with a single output, you can simply return a value directly from the `compute_fn`. Internally, this will be converted to a Dagster <PyObject object="Output"/> event with the default output name `result`:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_1 endbefore=end_op_output_1
@op
def my_simple_return_op(context):
    return 1
```

While this is perhaps the most intuitive way to return a value from a function, once you have multiple outputs defined on your op, or want to yield additional, non-output information from the body of your op, explicitly returning a value is no longer an option. In these cases, you'll want to explicitly yield <PyObject object="Output"/> events. With that in mind, the above example can be converted to the equivalent yield pattern like so:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_0 endbefore=end_op_output_0
@op
def my_simple_yield_op(context):
    yield Output(1)
```

or, if you have a specific output name other than the default `result`:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_2 endbefore=end_op_output_2
@op(out={"my_output": Out(int)})
def my_named_yield_op(context):
    yield Output(1, output_name="my_output")
```

Check out the docs on [Op Outputs](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids#outputs) to learn more.

#### Attaching Metadata to Outputs <Experimental/>

If there is information specific to an <PyObject object="Output"/> that you would like to log, you may optionally represent that by passing in a `metadata` parameter containing a mapping of string labels to metadata values.

The <PyObject object="EventMetadata" /> class contains a set of static wrappers to customize the display of certain types of structured metadata.

The following example demonstrates how you might use this functionality:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_3 endbefore=end_op_output_3
@op
def my_metadata_output(context):
    df = get_some_data()
    yield Output(
        df,
        metadata={
            "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
            "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"),
            "raw_count": len(df),
            "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
        },
    )
```

### Asset Materializations

<PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events tell Dagster that you have written
some data asset to an external system. The classic example would be writing to a
table in a database, but really any sort of persisted object that you would want
to keep track of can be considered an asset.

Generally, you'd want to send this event directly after you persist the asset to your external system. All <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events must define an `asset_key`, which is a unique identifier to describe the asset you are persisting.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_asset_op endbefore=end_asset_op
@op
def my_asset_op(context):
    df = get_some_data()
    store_to_s3(df)
    yield AssetMaterialization(
        asset_key="s3.my_asset",
        description="A df I stored in s3",
    )

    result = do_some_transform(df)
    yield Output(result)
```

To learn more about assets and how they are surfaced once you send this event, check out the [Asset Catalog](/concepts/dagit/dagit#assets) documentation.

#### Attaching Metadata to Asset Materializations

Attaching metadata to Asset Materializations is an important way of tracking aspects of a given asset over time. This functions essentially identically to other events which accept a `metadata` parameter, allowing you to attach a set of structured labels and values to display.

```python file=concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_materialization_ops_marker_2 endbefore=end_materialization_ops_marker_2
from dagster import op, AssetMaterialization, Output, EventMetadata


@op
def my_metadata_materialization_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    yield AssetMaterialization(
        asset_key="my_dataset",
        description="Persisted result to storage",
        metadata={
            "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
            "path": EventMetadata.path(remote_storage_path),
            "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"),
            "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
        },
    )
    yield Output(remote_storage_path)
```

### Expectation Results

Ops can emit structured events to represent the results of a data quality test. The data quality event class is the <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" />. To generate an expectation result, we can yield an <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" /> event in our op.

```python
@op
def my_expectation_op(context, df):
    do_some_transform(df)
    yield ExpectationResult(success=len(df) > 0, description="ensure dataframe has rows")
    yield Output(df)
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Expectation Results

Like many other event types in Dagster, there are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with an expectation result event, all through the <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> class. Each expectation event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log.

This example shows metadata entries of different types attached to the same expectation result:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_metadata_expectation_op endbefore=end_metadata_expectation_op
@op
def my_metadata_expectation_op(context, df):
    df = do_some_transform(df)
    yield ExpectationResult(
        success=len(df) > 0,
        description="ensure dataframe has rows",
        metadata={
            "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
            "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"),
            "raw_count": len(df),
            "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
        },
    )
    yield Output(df)
```

## Exceptions

Dagster also provides some op-specific exception classes, which can be raised to halt the execution of a op. The behavior after an exception is raised depends on the exception that you use. The exceptions are documented below.

### Failures

<PyObject object="Failure" /> exceptions may be raised to indicate that an op has
failed in an unrecoverable way, and that execution should stop. This may be useful
if, in the body of your op, you detect an issue that would not raise an error
on its own, but would still cause problems if the execution were to continue.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_failure_op endbefore=end_failure_op
@op
def my_failure_op():
    path = "/path/to/files"
    my_files = get_files(path)
    if len(my_files) == 0:
        raise Failure(
            description="No files to process",
            metadata={
                "filepath": EventMetadata.path(path),
                "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/failures"),
            },
        )
    return some_calculation(my_files)
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Failures

As is the case with many Dagster-provided classes, you can attach a list <PyObject object="EventMetadataEntry"/> denoting an arbitrary set of metadata relevant to the failure.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_failure_metadata_op endbefore=end_failure_metadata_op
@op
def my_failure_metadata_op():
    path = "/path/to/files"
    my_files = get_files(path)
    if len(my_files) == 0:
        raise Failure(
            description="No files to process",
            metadata={
                "filepath": EventMetadata.path(path),
                "dashboard_url": EventMetadata.url("http://mycoolsite.com/failures"),
            },
        )
    return some_calculation(my_files)
```

### Retry Requests

<PyObject object="RetryRequested" /> exceptions are useful when you experience failures
that are possible to recover from. For example, if you have a flaky operation that
you expect to throw an exception once in a while, you can catch the exception and
throw a <PyObject object="RetryRequested" /> to make Dagster halt and re-start op
execution.

You can configure the number of retries to be attempted with the `max_retries` parameter.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/op_events.py startafter=start_retry_op endbefore=end_retry_op
@op
def my_retry_op():
    try:
        result = flaky_operation()
    except:
        raise RetryRequested(max_retries=3)
    return result
```

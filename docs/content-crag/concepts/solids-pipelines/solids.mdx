# Ops

Ops are the functional unit of work in Dagster. An op's responsibility is to read its inputs, perform an action, and emit outputs. Multiple ops can be connected to create a [Job](/concepts/solids-pipelines/jobs).

## Overview

Ops are used to define computations. Ops can later be assembled into [Jobs](/concepts/solids-pipelines/jobs). Ops generally perform one specific action and are used for batch computations. For example, you can use an op to:

- Derive a data set from some other data sets.
- Execute a database query.
- Initiate a Spark job in a remote cluster.
- Query an API and store the result in a data warehouse.
- Send an email or Slack message.

Depending on how you execute a job, Dagster can run all the ops in the job within the same process or isolate them in different processes.

Ops have several important properties:

- **Inputs and Outputs**: Ops have defined [inputs and outputs](#inputs-and-outputs), which can be optionally typed. These types are validated at runtime.
- **Configurable**: Ops can be configured, using a strongly typed [configuration system](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).
- **Emit an Event Stream**: Ops can emit a stream of structured events, such as AssetMaterializations. These events can be viewed in [Dagit](/concepts/dagit/dagit), Dagster's UI tool.
- **Individually testable**: See the [testing page](/concepts/testing) for more detail.

## Defining an op

To define an op, use the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator. The decorated function is called the `compute_fn`.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_marker endbefore=end_op_marker
@op
def my_op():
    return "hello"
```

### Inputs and Outputs

Each op has a set of inputs and outputs, which define the data it consumes and produces. Inputs and outputs are used to define dependencies between ops and to pass data between ops.

Both definitions have a few important properties:

- They are named.
- They are optionally typed. These types are validated at runtime.
- (Advanced) They can be linked to an <PyObject object="IOManager"/>, which defines how the output or input is stored and loaded. See the [IOManager concept page](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) for more info.

#### Inputs

Inputs are passed as arguments to an op's `compute_fn`. The value of an input can be passed from the output of another op, or stubbed (hardcoded) using config.

The most common way to define inputs is just to add arguments to the decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_input_op_marker endbefore=end_input_op_marker
@op
def my_input_op(abc, xyz):
    pass
```

An op only starts to execute once all of its inputs have been resolved. Inputs can be resolved in two ways:

- The upstream output that the input depends on has been successfully emitted and stored.
- The input was stubbed through config.

You can use a [Dagster Type](/concepts/types) to provide a function that validates an op's input every time the op runs. In this case, you use a dictionary of <PyObject object="In" pluralize /> corresponding to the decorated function arguments.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_typed_input_op_marker endbefore=end_typed_input_op_marker
MyDagsterType = DagsterType(type_check_fn=lambda _, value: value % 2 == 0, name="MyDagsterType")


@op(ins={"abc": In(dagster_type=MyDagsterType)})
def my_typed_input_op(abc):
    pass
```

#### Outputs

Outputs are yielded from an op's `compute_fn`. By default, all ops have a single output called "result".

When you have one output, you can return the output value directly.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_output_op_marker endbefore=end_output_op_marker
@op
def my_output_op():
    return 5
```

To define multiple outputs, or to use a different output name than "result", you can provide a dictionary of <PyObject object="Out" pluralize /> to the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator.

When you have more than one output, you can return a tuple of values, one for each output.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_multi_output_op_marker endbefore=end_multi_output_op_marker
@op(out={"first_output": Out(), "second_output": Out()})
def my_multi_output_op():
    return 5, 6
```

Like inputs, outputs can also have [Dagster Types](/concepts/types).

### Op Context

When writing an op, users can optionally provide a first parameter, `context`. When this parameter is supplied, Dagster will supply a context object to the body of the op. The context provides access to system information like op configuration, loggers, resources, and the current run id. See <PyObject object="OpExecutionContext"/> for the full list of properties accessible from the op context.

For example, to access the logger and log a info message:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_context_marker endbefore=end_op_context_marker
@op(config_schema={"name": str})
def context_op(context):
    name = context.op_config["name"]
    context.log.info(f"My name is {name}")
```

### Op Configuration

All definitions in dagster expose a `config_schema`, making them configurable and parameterizable. The configuration system is explained in detail on [Config Schema](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).

Op definitions can specify a `config_schema` for the op's configuration. The configuration is accessible through the [op context](#op-context) at runtime. Therefore, op configuration can be used to specify op behavior at runtime, making ops more flexible and reusable.

For example, we can define an op where the API endpoint it queries is define through it's configuration:

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_configured_op_marker endbefore=end_configured_op_marker
@op(config_schema={"api_endpoint": str})
def my_configurable_op(context):
    api_endpoint = context.op_config["api_endpoint"]
    data = requests.get(f"{api_endpoint}/data").json()
    return data
```

## Using an op

Ops are used within a [Job](/concepts/solids-pipelines/jobs) or [Graph](/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipelines). You can also execute a single op, usually within a test context, by directly invoking it. More information can be found at [Testing ops](/concepts/testing#testing-ops).

## Patterns

### Op Factory

You may find the need to create utilities that help generate ops. In most cases, you should parameterize op behavior by adding op configuration. You should reach for this pattern if you find yourself needing to vary the arguments to the <PyObject object="op" decorator /> decorator or <PyObject object="OpDefinition"/> themselves, since they cannot be modified based on op configuration.

To create an op factory, you define a function that returns an <PyObject object="OpDefinition"/>, either directly or by decorating a function with the op decorator.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/solids.py startafter=start_op_factory_pattern_marker endbefore=end_op_factory_pattern_marker
def x_op(
    arg,
    name="default_name",
    ins=None,
    **kwargs,
):
    """
    Args:
        args (any): One or more arguments used to generate the nwe op
        name (str): The name of the new op.
        ins (Dict[str, In]): Any Ins for the new op. Default: None.

    Returns:
        function: The new op.
    """

    @op(name=name, ins=ins or {"start": In(Nothing)}, **kwargs)
    def _x_op(context):
        # Op logic here
        pass

    return _x_op
```

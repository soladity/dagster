# GraphQL API

Dagster exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to interact with Dagster programmatically. The API allows users to:

- Query information about Dagster runs (both historical and currently executing)
- Retrieve metadata about repositories, jobs, and ops (such as dependency structure and config schemas)
- Launch job executions and re-executions, allowing users to trigger executions on custom events

## Note about breaking changes

The GraphQL API is still evolving and is subject to breaking changes. A large portion of the API is primarily for internal use by Dagit. For any of the queries below, we will be clear about breaking changes in release notes.

## Using the GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is served alongside the Dagit web server. To start the server, run `dagit` in your Dagster workspace.

    dagit

Dagit serves the GraphQL endpoint at the `/graphql` endpoint. If you are running Dagit locally on port 3000, you can access the API at `localhost:3000/graphql`

### Using the GraphQL Playground

You can access the GraphQL Playground by navigating to the `/graphql` route in your browser. The GraphQL Playground contains the full GraphQL Schema and an interactive playground to write and test queries and mutations.

### Exploring the GraphQL Schema and Documentation

Clicking on the `Docs` tab on the right edge of the playground opens up interactive documentation for the GraphQL API. The interactive documentation is the best way to explore the API and get information about which fields are available on the queries and mutations.

## Python Client (Experimental)

Dagster also provides a <Link href="/concepts/dagit/graphql-client">Python Client</Link> <Experimental /> to interface with Dagster's GraphQL API from Python.

## Example Queries

### Get a list of Dagster runs

To retrieve a list of all runs, use the `runsOrError` query.

    query RunsQuery {
      runsOrError {
        __typename
        ... on Runs {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on RunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Pagination

You may eventually accumulate too many runs to return in one query. The `runsOrError` query takes in optional `cursor` and `limit` arguments for pagination:

    query PaginatedRunsQuery {
      runsOrError(
        cursor: "7fd2e5ef-5591-43db-be15-1ebbbbed8bb5"
        limit: 10
      ) {
        __typename
        ... on Runs {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on RunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

#### Filters

The `runsOrError` query also takes in an optional filter argument, of type `RunsFilter`. This query allows you to filter runs by:

- run ID
- job name
- tags
- statuses

For example, the following query will return all failed runs:

    query FilteredRunsQuery {
      runsOrError(filter: { statuses: [FAILURE] }) {
        __typename
        ... on Runs {
          results {
            runId
            pipelineName
            status
            runConfigYaml
            stats {
              ... on RunStatsSnapshot {
                startTime
                endTime
                stepsFailed
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Get a list of repositories

This query returns the names and location names of all the repositories currently loaded.

    query RepositoriesQuery {
      repositoriesOrError {
        ... on RepositoryConnection {
          nodes {
            name
            location {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Get a list of pipelines within a repository:

Given a repository, this query returns the names of all the pipelines in the repository.

This query takes a `selector`, which is of type `RepositorySelector`. A repository selector consists of both the repository location name and repository name.

    query PipelinesQuery(
      $repositoryLocationName: String!
      $repositoryName: String!
    ) {
      repositoryOrError(
        repositorySelector: {
          repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
          repositoryName: $repositoryName
        }
      ) {
        ... on Repository {
          pipelines {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Launch a run

To launch a run, we can use the `launchRun` mutation. Here, we define `LaunchRunMutation` to wrap our mutation and allow us to pass in the required arguments as query variables.

For this query, the required arguments are:

`selector`:

- This is a dictionary that contains the repository location name, repository name, and job name

`runConfigData`:

- This is where you define the run config to execute the pipeline with
- Note that `runConfigData` is of type `RunConfigData`. This type is used when passing in an arbitrary object for run config. This is any-typed in the GraphQL type system but must conform to the constraints of the config schema for this pipeline. If it does not, the mutation returns a `RunConfigValidationInvalid` response

<!---->

    mutation LaunchRunMutation(
      $repositoryLocationName: String!
      $repositoryName: String!
      $jobName: String!
      $runConfigData: RunConfigData!
    ) {
      launchRun(
        executionParams: {
          selector: {
            repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
            repositoryName: $repositoryName
            pipelineName: $jobName
          }
          runConfigData: $runConfigData
        }
      ) {
        __typename
        ... on LaunchRunSuccess {
          run {
            runId
          }
        }
        ... on RunConfigValidationInvalid {
          errors {
            message
            reason
          }
        }
        ... on PythonError {
          message
        }
      }
    }

### Terminate an in-progress run

If you want to stop execution of an in-progress run, use the `terminateRun` mutation. The only required argument for this mutation is the ID of the run.

    mutation TerminateRun($runId: String!) {
      terminateRun(runId: $runId){
        __typename
        ... on TerminateRunSuccess{
          run {
            runId
          }
        }
        ... on TerminateRunFailure {
          message
        }
        ... on RunNotFoundError {
          runId
        }
        ... on PythonError {
          message
          stack
        }
      }
    }

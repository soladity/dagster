# Resources

Resources provide a way to manage dependencies to external APIs. Together with jobs, they can be used to represent multiple different execution environments for a graph.

| <PyObject object="resource" decorator />         | The decorator used to define resources. The decorated function is called a `resource_fn`. The decorator returns a <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" />.                                                                 |
| <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" />         | Class for resource definitions. You almost never want to use initialize this class directly. Instead, you should use the <PyObject object="resource" decorator /> which returns a <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" />. |
| <PyObject object="InitResourceContext"/>         | The context object provided to a resource during initialization. This object contains required resource, config, and other run information.                                                                                 |
| <PyObject object="build_init_resource_context"/> | Function for building an <PyObject object="InitResourceContext"/> outside of execution, intended to be used when testing a resource.                                                                                        |

## Overview

You can use **resources** to provide access to features of the execution environment to ops. You can bind a set of resources (and other environment information) to a job so that those resources can be available to the ops within that job. You can construct different jobs for the same graph, each with different resources, to represent the execution environments that your graph will be run within.

### Why Use Resources

Representing external dependencies as resources, in conjunction with jobs, has very convenient properties:

- **Pluggable**: You can map a resource to a key in one job, and then map a different resource to that same key in a different job. This is useful if there is a heavy external dependency that you want to use in production, but avoid using it in testing. You can simply provide different resource sets for each execution case: one for production with the heavy dependency (e.g., AWS) as a resource, and one for testing with something lighter (i.e., in-memory store) mapped to the same key. For more information about this capability, check out [Separating Business Logic from Environments](/concepts/testing#separating-business-logic-from-environments).
- **Job Scoped**: Since resources are job scoped, if you provide a resource to a job, then it becomes available for use with every op in that job.
- **Configurable**: Resources can be configured, using a strongly typed [configuration system](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).
- **Dependencies**: Resources can depend on other resources. This makes it possible to cleanly represent external environment objects that rely on other external environment information for initialization.

## Defining a Resource

To define a resource, use the <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator. Wrap a function that takes an `init_context` as the first parameter, which is an instance of <PyObject object="InitResourceContext"/>. From this function, return or yield the object that you would like to be available as a resource.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_example endbefore=end_resource_example
from dagster import resource


class ExternalCerealFetcher:
    def fetch_new_cereals(self, start_ts, end_ts):
        pass


@resource
def cereal_fetcher(init_context):
    return ExternalCerealFetcher()
```

## Accessing Resources in Ops

Ops use resource keys to access resources, like so:

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_op_with_resources_example endbefore=end_op_with_resources_example
from dagster import op

CREATE_TABLE_1_QUERY = "create table_1 as select * from table_0"


@op(required_resource_keys={"database"})
def op_requires_resources(context):
    context.resources.database.execute_query(CREATE_TABLE_1_QUERY)
```

## Testing Resource Initialization

You can test the initialization of a resource by invoking the resource definition. This will run the underlying decorated function.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_testing endbefore=end_resource_testing
from dagster import resource


@resource
def my_resource(_):
    return "foo"


def test_my_resource():
    assert my_resource(None) == "foo"
```

If your resource requires other resources or config, then you can provide a <PyObject object="InitResourceContext" /> object by using the <PyObject object="build_init_resource_context" /> function.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_testing_with_context endbefore=end_resource_testing_with_context
from dagster import build_init_resource_context, resource


@resource(required_resource_keys={"foo"}, config_schema={"bar": str})
def my_resource_requires_context(init_context):
    return init_context.resources.foo, init_context.resource_config["bar"]


def test_my_resource_with_context():
    init_context = build_init_resource_context(
        resources={"foo": "foo_str"}, config={"bar": "bar_str"}
    )
    assert my_resource_requires_context(init_context) == ("foo_str", "bar_str")
```

If your resource is a context manager, then you can open it as one using python's `with` syntax.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_cm_resource_testing endbefore=end_cm_resource_testing
from contextlib import contextmanager
from dagster import resource


@resource
@contextmanager
def my_cm_resource(_):
    yield "foo"


def test_cm_resource():
    with my_cm_resource(None) as initialized_resource:
        assert initialized_resource == "foo"
```

## Providing Resources to a Job

When creating a job, resource definitions can be provided via the `resource_defs` argument on the <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job"/> function.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_job_example endbefore=end_job_example
from dagster import graph


@graph
def basic_graph():
    basic_op()


job = basic_graph.to_job(resource_defs={"a": resource_a, "b": resource_b})
```

## Examples

### Resource Configuration

<PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" pluralize /> can have a config schema, which
allows you to customize behavior at runtime through pipeline configuration.

For example, let's say we wanted to pass a connection string to our `DatabaseConnection` resource.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_config endbefore=end_resource_config
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self, connection: str):
        self.connection = connection


@resource(config_schema={"connection": str})
def db_resource(init_context):
    connection = init_context.resource_config["connection"]
    return DatabaseConnection(connection)
```

### Resource to Resource Dependencies

Resources can depend upon other resources. Use the `required_resource_keys` parameter of the <PyObject object="resource" decorator/> decorator to specify which resources to depend upon. Access the required resources through the context object provided to the wrapped function.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_dep_example endbefore=end_resource_dep_example
from dagster import resource


@resource
def credentials():
    return ("bad_username", "easy_password")


@resource(required_resource_keys={"credentials"})
def client(init_context):
    username, password = init_context.resources.credentials
    return Client(username, password)
```

Now, consider a graph whose ops will use the `client` resource.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_dep_graph endbefore=end_resource_dep_graph
from dagster import graph, op


@op(required_resource_keys={"client"})
def get_client(context):
    return context.resources.client


@graph
def connect():
    return get_client()
```

When constructing a job out of `connect`, we provide the resource `client`, but also `credentials`, as `client` requires it.

```python file=/concepts/resources/resources.py startafter=start_resource_dep_job endbefore=end_resource_dep_job
connect_job = connect.to_job(resource_defs={"credentials": credentials, "client": client})
```

# Partitions

Dagster provides the _Partition Set_ abstraction for pipelines where each run deals with a subset of
config data.

| <PyObject object="PartitionSetDefinition" /> | The class to define a partition set. |

## Overview

Users define a set of logical "partitions", usually time windows, along with a scheme for building
pipeline config from a partition name. With this, they can kick off a pipeline run or set of
pipeline runs by simply selecting a partition or set of partitions.

Partitions have two main uses:

- [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules): you can schedule pipeline to run on a
  per partition basis. For example, you can config the date as a partition and schedule pipeline runs
  on a daily basis.
- [Backfills](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/backfill): you can execute pipelines per partition
  all at once. A common use case is to backfill a set of partitions where the historical data need
  to be reprocessed.

## Defining a Partition

For example, here's a pipeline that computes some data for a given date.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/pipeline.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker_1 endbefore=end_pipeline_marker_1
@solid(config_schema={"date": str})
def process_data_for_date(context):
    date = context.solid_config["date"]
    context.log.info(f"processing data for {date}")


@solid
def post_slack_message(context):
    context.log.info("posting slack message")


@pipeline
def my_data_pipeline():
    process_data_for_date()
    post_slack_message()
```

The solid `process_data_for_date` takes, as config, a string `date`. This piece of config will
define which date to compute data for. For example, if we wanted to compute for May 5th, 2020,
we would execute the pipeline with the following config:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/config.yaml
solids:
  process_data_for_date:
    config:
      date: "2020-05-05"
```

We can define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PartitionSetDefinition"/> that defines the full set of
partitions and how to define the run config for a given partition.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/partition_definition.py startafter=start_def endbefore=end_def
def get_date_partitions():
    """Every day in the month of May, 2020"""
    return [Partition(f"2020-05-{str(day).zfill(2)}") for day in range(1, 32)]


def run_config_for_date_partition(partition):
    date = partition.value
    return {"solids": {"process_data_for_date": {"config": {"date": date}}}}


date_partition_set = PartitionSetDefinition(
    name="date_partition_set",
    pipeline_name="my_data_pipeline",
    partition_fn=get_date_partitions,
    run_config_fn_for_partition=run_config_for_date_partition,
)
```

## Launching Partitions

### Launching Partitioned Runs from the Partitions Tab

In Dagit, you can view runs by partition in the Partitions tab of a Pipeline page.

In the "Run Matrix", each column corresponds to one of the partitions in the partition set. Each row corresponds to one
of the steps in the pipeline.

    * Navigating to the partitions page for `my_data_pipeline`

You can click on individual boxes to see the history of runs for that step and partition.

### Launching Partitioned Runs from the Playground

You can view and use partitions in the Dagit playground view for a pipeline. In the top bar, you can
select from the list of all available partition sets, then choose a specific partition.
Within the config editor, the config for the selected partition will be populated.

In the screenshot below, we select the `date_partition_set` and the `2020-05-01` partition, and we can see that
the correct run config for the partition has been populated in the editor.

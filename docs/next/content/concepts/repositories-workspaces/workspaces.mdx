# Workspaces

Tools in Dagster ecosystem, such as Dagit and the Dagster CLI, need to know where to find user code
in order to load it. This process is managed by Dagster _workspaces_. A workspace is a collection
of user-defined repositories and information about where they reside.

## Overview

A Dagster Workspace can contain multiple [repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories)
sourced from a variety of different external locations, such as Python modules and Python virtualenvs.

The repositories in a workspace are loaded into their own "user" processes distinct from the Dagster
framework process. This architectural has a couple of advantages:

- When there is an update to user code, Dagit can pick up the change without a restart.
- You can use repositories to organize pipelines, but still work on all of your repositories using a single running Dagit.
- The Dagit process can run in a separate Python environment from user code so pipeline dependencies
  do not need to be installed into the Dagit environment.
- Each repository can be sourced from a separate Python environment, so teams can manage their dependencies
  (or even their own Python versions) separately.

## Defining a Workspace

### Workspace YAML

The structure of a workspace is encoded in a yaml document. By convention is it named `workspace.yaml`.
The workspace yaml encodes what repositories to load and their location.

Each entry in the workspace is referred to as a _repository location_. A repository location can
include more than one repository. Each repository location is loaded in its own server process that
Dagster tools use an RPC protocol to communicate with. This process separation allows multiple
repository locations in different environments to be loaded independently, and ensures that errors
in user code can't impact Dagster system code.

### Loading Repositories

If you want to load repositories from Python code, use the `python_file` or `python_package` keys
in your workspace YAML.

If you use `python_file`, it must specify a path relative to the workspace file leading to a file
containing at least one repository definition. For example, the repository here:

```python file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/hello_world_repository.py
from dagster import pipeline, repository, solid


@solid
def hello_world(_):
    pass


@pipeline
def hello_world_pipeline():
    hello_world()


@repository
def hello_world_repository():
    return [hello_world_pipeline]
```

The repository could be loaded using the following workspace file in the same folder:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file: hello_world_repository.py
```

Now we save the yaml file as `workspace.yaml`.

## Using a Workspace

Dagit will look for `workspace.yaml` in the current directory by default, so now you can launch Dagit
from that directory with no arguments.

    dagit

<img src="/images/concepts/workspace-dagit.png" />

Having a yaml file `workspace.yaml` is convenient: it prevents you from having to type the same
`-f`or`-m`flag repeatedly. You can also load the workspace via `-w`. See detailed references
in [`dagit`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagit).

## Examples

### Loading one repository

Sometimes you might have more than one repository in scope and want to specify a specific
one. Our schema supports this as well through the `attribute` key, which must be a repository
name or the name of a function that returns a <PyObject object="RepositoryDefinition" />. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_one_repository.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: hello_world_repository.py
      attribute: hello_world_repository
```

The example above also illustrates that the `python_file` key can be a single string if the
only configuration needed is the relative file path, but must be a map if more parameters are added.

### Loading relative imports

By default, if you use `python_file` your code will load with no working directory available to
resolve imports in your code. You can supply a custom working directory for relative imports using
the `working_directory` key. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_working_directory.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: hello_world_repository.py
      working_directory: my_working_directory/
```

### Loading Python package

`python_package` can also be used instead of `python_file` to load code from an installed Python
package.

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_python_package.yaml
load_from:
  - python_package: hello_world_package
```

A deprecated `python_module` key with similar semantics also exists, but you
should prefer using either `python_package` if the code is in an installed package and does not
require specifying a working directory, or `python_file` if it does not.

You can also specify an attribute to identify a single repository within a package, as with
`python_file`:

```yaml
load_from:
  - python_package:
      package_name: yourproject.hello_world_repository
      attribute: hello_world_repository
```

### Loading multiple repositories

#### Multiple Python environments

By default, Dagit and other Dagster tools assume that repository locations should be loaded using the same
Python environment that was used to load Dagster. However, it is often useful for repository
locations to use independent environments. For example, a data engineering team running Spark can
have dramatically different dependencies than an ML team running Tensorflow.

To enable this use case, Dagster supports customizing the Python environment for each repository
location, by adding the `executable_path` key to the YAML for a location. These environments can
involve distinct sets of installed dependencies, or even completely different Python versions.

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/python_environment_example.yaml
load_from:
  - python_package:
      package_name: dataengineering_spark_repository
      location_name: dataengineering_spark_team_py_38_virtual_env
      executable_path: venvs/path/to/dataengineering_spark_team/bin/python
  - python_file:
      relative_path: path/to/team_repos.py
      location_name: ml_team_py_36_virtual_env
      executable_path: venvs/path/to/ml_tensorflow/bin/python
```

#### Identify repository locations

The example above also illustrates the `location_name` key. Each repository location in a workspace
has a unique name that is displayed in Dagit, and is also used to disambiguate
definitions with the same name across multiple repository locations. Dagster will supply a default name
for each location based on its workspace entry if a custom one is not supplied.

Renaming a repository location (or changing its workspace configuration if you're using the default
name) may cause parts of the Dagster system that rely on that name to need to be re-configured. For
example, you may need to restart any schedules in that repository location, since those schedules
were marked as started using the previous repository location name. You can avoid this situation
by giving each of your locations a unique name as soon as you add them to the workspace.

#### Repository locations in Dagit

If you run `dagit` in the same folder as a `workspace.yaml` file, it will load all the repositories
in each repository location defined by the workspace. (You can also specify a different workspace
file using the `-w` command-line argument).

It's possible that one or more of your repository locations can't be loaded - for example, there
might be a syntax error or some other unrecoverable error in one of your definitions. When this occurs,
a warning message will appear in Dagit in the left-hand panel, directing you to a status page with
an error message and stack trace for any locations that were unable to load.

### Running your own gRPC server

By default, Dagster tools will automatically create a server process on your local machine for
each of your repository locations. However, it is also possible to run your own gRPC server
that's responsible for serving information about your repositories. This can be useful in more
complex system architectures that deploy user code separately from Dagit.

The Dagster gRPC server needs to have access to your code. To initialize the server, run
the `dagster api grpc` command and pass it a target file or module to load.

Similar to when specifying code in your `workspace.yaml`, the target can be either a
python file or installed python package, and you can use an 'attribute' flag to
identify a single repository within that target. The server will automatically find
and load the specified repositories.

You also need to specify a host and either a post or socket to run the server on.

    # Load gRPC Server using python file:
    dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
    dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port /path/to/socket

    # Load gRPC Server using python package:
    dagster api grpc --package-name my_package_name --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
    dagster api grpc --package-name my_package_name --host 0.0.0.0 --socket /path/to/socket

    # Specify an attribute within the target to load a specific repository:
    dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --attribute my_repository --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
    dagster api grpc --package-name my_package_name --attribute my_repository --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266

Then, in your `workspace.yaml`, you can configure a new gRPC server repository location to load:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_grpc.yaml
load_from:
  - grpc_server:
      host: localhost
      port: 4266
      location_name: "my_grpc_server"
```

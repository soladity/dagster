# Scheduling Date Partitions

When using date partitions, it is common to want to set up a schedule to
run the date partitioned pipeline on a regular cadence, where at each
scheduled execution time we execute a pipeline run corresponding to the
most recently elapsed date partition.

To support this use case, we've added helpful decorators to define a
schedule definition and a corresponding date partition set:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="hourly_schedule" displayText="@hourly_schedule" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="daily_schedule" displayText="@daily_schedule" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="weekly_schedule" displayText="@weekly_schedule" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="monthly_schedule" displayText="@monthly_schedule" />

We can use the monthly decorator to create a partition set and schedule
definition for our pipeline:

```python literalinclude caption=schedules.py
file:/dagster_examples/stocks/schedules.py
```

Make sure to include a reference to the function in `repository.yaml`:

``` YAML
scheduler:
     file: schedules.py
     fn: define_schedules
```

When we load dagit, we'll see our schedule as expected:

# Telemetry

As an open source project, we collect usage statistics to better understand how
users engage with dagster and to inform development priorities. Telemetry data
will motivate projects such as adding functionality in frequently-used parts
of the CLI and will help us understand adoption of new features.

We will not see or store any data that is processed within solids and
pipelines. We will not see or store solid definitions (including generated context)
or pipeline definitions (including modes and resources).

The telemetry-instrumented functions are:

```python literalinclude showLines caption=telemetry.py
file:../python_modules/dagster/dagster/core/telemetry.py
lines:51-55
```

To see the logs we send, open `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs/` if `$DAGSTER_HOME` is set or
`~/.dagster/logs/` if not set (after calling the instrumented functions).

If you'd like to opt-out, you can add the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` (creating
that file if necessary):

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```

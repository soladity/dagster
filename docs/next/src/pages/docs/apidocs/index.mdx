# API Docs

These docs aim to cover the entire public surface of the `dagster` APIs,
as well as, eventually, public APIs from all the associated libraries.

Dagster follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/), and is currently pre-1.0.
We are attempting to isolate breaking changes to the public APIs to
minor versions (on a roughly 12-week cadence) and will announce
deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions (on a
roughly weekly cadence).

**Core**

APIs from the core `dagster` package are divided roughly by topic:

- [Solids](/docs/apidocs/solids)
  APIs to define or decorate functions as solids, declare their inputs
  and outputs, compose solids with each other, as well as the
  datatypes that solid execution can return or yield.

- [Pipelines](/docs/apidocs/pipeline)
  APIs to define pipelines, dependencies and fan-in dependencies
  between solids, and aliased instances of solids; pipeline modes,
  resources, loggers, presets, and repositories.

- [Execution](/docs/apidocs/execution)
  APIs to execute and test pipelines and individual solids, the
  execution context available to solids, pipeline configuration, the
  default system storages used for intermediates, and the default
  executors available for executing pipelines.

- [Types](/docs/apidocs/types)
  Primitive types available for the input and output values of solids,
  and the APIs used to define and test new Dagster types.

- [Config](/docs/apidocs/config)
  The types available to describe config schemas.

- [Schedules](/docs/apidocs/schedules)
  APIs to define schedules on which pipelines are run, as well as a
  few built-in defaults.

- [Partitions](/docs/apidocs/partitions)
  APIs to define partitions of the config space over which pipeline
  runs can be backfilled.

- [Errors](/docs/apidocs/errors)
  Errors thrown by the Dagster framework.

- [Dagster CLI](/docs/apidocs/cli)
  Browse repositories and execute pipelines from the command line

- [Utilities](/docs/apidocs/utilities)
  Miscellaneous helpers used by Dagster that may be useful to users.

- [Internals](/docs/apidocs/internals)
  Core internal APIs that are important if you are interested in
  understanding how Dagster works with an eye towards extending it:
  logging, executors, system storage, the Dagster instance & plugin
  machinery, storage, schedulers.

**Libraries**

Dagster includes a number of non-core libraries that provide
integrations and additional functionality:

- [Airflow](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_airflow)
  (`dagster_airflow`)
  Tools for compiling Dagster pipelines to Airflow DAGs.

- [AWS](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_aws) (`dagster_aws`)
  Tools for working with AWS, including using S3 for intermediates
  storage.

- [Celery](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_celery)
  (`dagster_celery`)
  Provides an executor built on top of the popular [Celery task
  queue](http:/www.celeryproject.org/).

- [Cron](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_cron)
  (`dagster_cron`)
  Provides a simple scheduler implementation built on system cron.

- [Dask](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_dask)
  (`dagster_dask`)
  Provides an executor built on top of
  [dask.distributed](https:/distributed.dask.org/en/latest/).

- [GCP](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_gcp) (`dagster_gcp`)
  Tools for working with GCP, including using GCS for intermediates
  storage.

- [Jupyter](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagstermill)
  (`dagstermill`)
  Wraps Jupyter notebooks as solids for integrated execution within
  pipeline runs.

- [Kubernetes](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_k8s)
  (`dagster_k8s`)
  Tools for deploying Dagster to Kubernetes.

- [Postgres](/docs/apidocs/libraries/dagster_postgres)
  (`dagster_postgres`)
  Includes implementations of run and event log storage built on
  Postgres.

### Parametrizing Solids with Inputs

So far, we've only seen solids whose behavior is the same every time
they're run:

```python literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/serial_pipeline.py
caption:serial_pipeline.py
lineno-start:6
lines:6-15
```

In general, though, rather than relying on hardcoded values like
`dataset_path`, we'd like to be able to parametrize our solid logic.
Appropriately parameterized solids are more testable, and also more
reusable. Consider the following more generic solid:

```python literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/inputs.py
caption:inputs.py
lineno-start:6
lines:6-12
```

Here, rather than hardcoding the value of `dataset_path`, we use an
input, `csv_path`. It's easy to see why this is better. We can reuse
the same solid in all the different places we might need to read in a
.csv from a filepath. We can test the solid by pointing it at some known
test csv file. And we can use the output of another upstream solid to
determine which file to load.

Let's rebuild a pipeline we've seen before, but this time using our
newly parameterized solid.

```python literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/inputs.py
caption:inputs.py
lines:1-36
emphasize-lines:36
```

### Specifying Config for Pipeline Execution

As you can see above, what's missing from this setup is a way to specify the `csv_path` input to our
new `read_csv` solid in the absence of any upstream solids whose outputs we can rely on. Dagster
provides the ability to stub inputs to solids that aren't satisfied by the pipeline topology as part
of its flexible configuration facility.

We can specify config for a pipeline execution regardless of
which modality we use to execute the pipeline — the Python API, the
Dagit GUI, or the command line:

  <summary>Specifying config in the Python API</summary>

<br />

We previously encountered the <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" displayText="execute_pipeline()" />function.
Pipeline configuration is specified by the second argument to this function,
which must be a dict (the "environment dict").

This dict contains all of the user-provided configuration with which to
execute a pipeline. As such, it can have [a lot of sections](/docs/apidocs/execution####config_schema), but
we'll only use one of them here: per-solid configuration, which is
specified under the key `solids`:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=41
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs.py
caption:inputs.py
lines:41-48
dedent:4
```

The `solids` dict is keyed by solid name, and each solid is configured
by a dict that may itself have several sections. In this case we are
only interested in the `inputs` section, so that we can specify the
value of the input `csv_path`.

Now you can pass this environment dict to <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" displayText="execute_pipeline()" />:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=49
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs.py
caption:inputs.py
lines:49-51
dedent:4
```

  <summary>Specifying config using YAML fragments and the dagster CLI</summary>

<br />

When executing pipelines with the dagster CLI, we'll need to provide the environment
dict in a config file. We use YAML for the file-based representation of an environment
dict, but the values are the same as before:

```YAML literalinclude showLines
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs_env.yaml
caption:inputs_env.yaml
dedent:4
```

We can pass config files in this format to the dagster CLI tool with the
`-e` flag.

```bash
$ dagster pipeline execute -f inputs.py -n inputs_pipeline -e inputs_env.yaml
```

In practice, you might have different sections of your environment dict
in different yaml files —if, for instance, some sections change more
often (e.g. in test and prod) while other are more static. In this case,
you can set multiple instances of the `-e` flag on CLI invocations, and
the CLI tools will assemble the YAML fragments into a single environment
dict.

  <summary>Using the Dagit config editor</summary>

<br />

Dagit provides a powerful, schema-aware, typeahead-enabled config editor to enable
rapid experimentation with and debugging of parameterized pipeline executions. As
always, run:

```bash
$ dagit -f inputs.py -n inputs_pipeline
```

Notice that no execution plan appears in the bottom pane of the Playground.

Because Dagit is schema-aware, it knows that this pipeline now requires
configuration in order to run without errors. In this case, since the pipeline
is relatively trivial, it wouldn't be especially costly to run the pipeline
and watch it fail. But when pipelines are complex and slow, it's invaluable to
get this kind of feedback up front rather than have an unexpected failure deep
inside a pipeline.

Recall that the execution plan, which you will ordinarily see above the log
viewer in the **Execute** tab, is the concrete pipeline that
Dagster will actually execute. Without a valid config, Dagster can't construct
a parametrization of the logical pipeline — so no execution plan is available
for us to preview.

Press _CTRL-Space_ in order to bring up the typeahead assistant.

Here you can see all of the sections available in the environment dict. Don't
worry, we'll get to them all later.

Let's enter the config we need in order to execute our pipeline.

![inputs_figure_three.png](/assets/images/tutorial/inputs_figure_three.png)

Note that as you type and edit the config, the config minimap hovering on the
right side of the editor pane changes to provide context — so you always know
where in the nested config schema you are while making changes.

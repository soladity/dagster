### Dagster Types

We've seen how we can type the inputs and outputs of solids using
Python 3's typing system, and how to use Dagster's built-in config
types, such as <PyObject module="dagster" object="String" displayText="dagster.String" />, to
define config schemas for our solids.

But what about when you want to define your own types?

This section will talk about the basics of Dagster's user defined types in the following order. You
can also learn more about Typing in Dagster by reading [Dagster Types Guide](learn/guides/dagster_types).

Let's look back at our simple `read_csv` solid.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=7 caption=inputs_typed.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/inputs_typed.py
lines:7-15
```

The `lines` object returned by Python's built-in `csv.DictReader` is a
list of `collections.OrderedDict`, each of which represents one row of
the dataset:

```python
[
    OrderedDict([
        ('name', '100% Bran'), ('mfr', 'N'), ('type', 'C'), ('calories', '70'), ('protein', '4'),
        ('fat', '1'), ('sodium', '130'), ('carbo', '5'), ('sugars', '6'), ('potass', '280'),
        ('vitamins', '25'), ('shelf', '3'), ('weight', '1'), ('cups', '0.33'),
        ('rating', '68.402973')
    ]),
    OrderedDict([
        ('name', '100% Natural Bran'), ('mfr', 'Q'), ('type', 'C'), ('calories', '120'),
        ('protein', '3'), ('fat', '5'), ('sodium', '15'), ('fiber', '2'), ('carbo', '8'),
        ('sugars', '8'), ('potass', '135'), ('vitamins', '0'), ('shelf', '3'), ('weight', '1'),
        ('cups', '1'), ('rating', '33.983679')
    ]),
    ...
]
```

This is a simple representation of a "data frame", or a table of data.
We'd like to be able to use Dagster's type system to type the output
of `read_csv`, so that we can do type checking when we construct the
pipeline, ensuring that any solid consuming the output of `read_csv`
expects to receive a data frame.

To do this, we'll use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="DagsterType" displayText="DagsterType" /> class:

```python literalinclude  showLines startLine=6 caption=custom_types.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types.py
lines:6-10
```

Now we can annotate the rest of our pipeline with our new type:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=13 emphasize-lines=2,12 caption=custom_types.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types.py
lines:13-36
```

The type metadata now appears in dagit and the system will ensure the
input and output to this solid are indeed instances of SimpleDataFrame.
As usual, run:

```bash
$ dagit -f custom_types.py -n custom_type_pipeline
```

![custom_types_figure_one.png](/assets/images/tutorial/custom_types_figure_one.png)

You can see that the output of `read_csv` (which by default has the name
`result`) is marked to be of type `SimpleDataFrame`.

<br />

#### Complex Type Checks

The Dagster framework will fail type checks when a value isn't an
instance of the type we're expecting, e.g., if `read_csv` were to
return a `str` rather than a `SimpleDataFrame`.

Sometimes we know more about the types of our values, and we'd like to
do deeper type checks. For example, in the case of the
`SimpleDataFrame`, we expect to see a list of OrderedDicts, and for each
of these OrderedDicts to have the same fields, in the same order.

The type check function allows us to do this.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=7 emphasize-lines=1,21 caption=custom_types_2.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_2.py
lines:7-30
```

Now, if our solid logic fails to return the right type, we'll see a
type check failure. Let's replace our `read_csv` solid with the
following bad logic:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=32 caption=custom_types_2.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_2.py
lines:32-39
```

When we run the pipeline with this solid, we'll see an error like:

```bash
2019-10-12 13:19:19 - dagster - ERROR - custom_type_pipeline - 266c6a93-75e2-46dc-8bd7-d684ce91d0d1 - STEP_FAILURE
- Execution of step "bad_read_csv.compute" failed.
            cls_name = "Failure"
            solid = "bad_read_csv"
    solid_definition = "bad_read_csv"
            step_key = "bad_read_csv.compute"
user_failure_data = {"description": "LessSimpleDataFrame should be a list of OrderedDicts, got <class 'str'>
for row 1", "label": "intentional-failure", "metadata_entries": []}
```

<br />

#### Providing Input Values for Custom Types in Config

We saw earlier how, when a solid doesn't receive all of its inputs from
other solids further upstream in the pipeline, we can specify its input
values in config:

```YAML literalinclude caption=inputs_env.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs_env.yaml
```

The Dagster framework knows how to interpret values provided via config
as scalar inputs. In this case, `read_csv` just takes the string
representation of the filepath from which it'll read a csv. But for
more complex, custom types, we need to tell Dagster how to interpret
config values.

Consider our LessSimpleDataFrame. It might be convenient if Dagster knew
automatically how to read a data frame in from a csv file, without us
needing to separate that logic into the `read_csv` solid -- especially
if we knew the provenance and format of that csv file (e.g., if we were
using standard csvs as an internal interchange format) and didn't need
the full configuration surface of a general purpose `read_csv` solid.

What we want to be able to do is write:

```YAML literalinclude caption=custom_type_input.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_type_input.yaml
```

In order for the Dagster machinery to be able to decode the config value
`{'csv': 'cereal.csv'}` into an input of the correct
`LessSimpleDataFrame` value, we need to write what we call an input
hydration config.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=32 caption=custom_types_3.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_3.py
lines:32-39
```

A function decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="input_hydration_config" displayText="@input_hydration_config" /> should
take the context object, as usual, and a parameter
representing the parsed config field. The schema for this field is
defined by the argument to the <PyObject module="dagster" object="input_hydration_config" displayText="@input_hydration_config" /> decorator.

Here, we introduce the <PyObject module="dagster" object="Selector" /> type,
which lets you specify mutually exclusive options in config schemas.
Here, there's only one option, `csv`, but you can imagine a more
sophisticated data frame type that might also know how to hydrate its
inputs from other formats and sources, and might have a selector with
fields like `parquet`, `xlsx`, `sql`, etc.

Then insert this into the original declaration:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=42 emphasize-lines=5 caption=custom_types_3.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_3.py
lines:42-47
```

Now if you run a pipeline with this solid from dagit you will be able to
provide sources for these inputs via config:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=70 caption=custom_types_3.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_3.py
lines:70-80
```

<br />

#### Testing Custom Types

As you write your own custom types, you'll also want to set up unit
tests that ensure your types are doing what you expect them to. Dagster
includes a utility function, <PyObject module="dagster" object="check_dagster_type" />,
that lets you type check any Dagster type against any value.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=102 caption=custom_types_test.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_test.py
lines:102-114
```

Well tested library types can be reused across solids and pipelines to
provide standardized type checking within your organization's data
applications.

<br />

#### MyPy Compliance

In cases where DagsterTypes are created that do not have corresponding
usable Python types, and the user wishes to remain mypy compliant, there
are two options.

One is using `InputDefinition` and `OutputDefinition` exclusively for
dagster types, and reserving type annotations for naked Python types
_only_. This is verbose, but is explicit and clear.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=21 emphasize-lines=1-5,14-15 caption=custom_types_mypy_verbose.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_mypy_verbose.py
lines:21-47
```

If one wishes to use type annotations exclusively but still use dagster
types without a 1:1 python type counterpart, the typechecking behavior
must be modified. For this we recommend using the `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`
property in the python typing module.

While inelegant, this centralizes boilerplate to the type instantiation,
rather than have it on all places where the type is referenced.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=7 emphasize-lines=1-8 caption=custom_types_mypy_typing_trick.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_mypy_typing_trick.py
lines:7-25
```

<br />

#### Metadata and Custom Type Checks

Custom types can also yield metadata about the type check. For example, in the
case of our data frame, we might want to record the number of rows and columns
in the dataset when our type checks succeed, and provide more information
about why type checks failed when they fail.
User-defined type check functions can optionally return a <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" /> object
that contains metadata about the success or failure of the type check.
Let's see how to use this to emit some summary statistics about our DataFrame
type:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=18 emphasize-lines=3-9,33-53 caption=custom_types_4.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality/custom_types_4.py
lines:18-71
```

A <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" displayText="TypeCheck" /> must include a
`success` argument describing whether the check
passed or failed, and may include a description and/or a list of <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> objects.
You should use the static constructors on <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> to
construct these objects, which are flexible enough to support arbitrary metadata in JSON or Markdown format.

Dagit knows how to display and archive structured metadata of this kind for
future review:

### Pipeline Config Presets

Useful as the Dagit config editor and the ability to stitch together
YAML fragments is, once pipelines have been productionized and config is
unlikely to change, it's often useful to distribute pipelines with
embedded config. For example, you might point solids at different S3
buckets in different environments, or want to pull database credentials
from different environment variables.

Dagster calls this a config preset:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=129 emphasize-lines=14-40
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/presets.py
caption:presets.py
lines:129-170
```

We illustrate two ways of defining a preset.

The first is to pass an `environment_dict` literal to the constructor.
Because this dict is defined in Python, you can do arbitrary computation
to construct it -- for instance, picking up environment variables,
making a call to a secrets store like Hashicorp Vault, etc.

The second is to use the `from_files` static constructor, and pass a
list of file globs from which to read YAML fragments. Order matters in
this case, and keys from later files will overwrite keys from earlier
files.

To select a preset for execution, we can use the CLI, the Python API, or
Dagit.

From the CLI, use `-p` or `--preset`:

```bash
$ dagster pipeline execute -f presets.py -n presets_pipeline -p unittest
```

From Python, you can use <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" />

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=174
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/presets.py
caption:presets.py
lines:174
dedent:4
```

And in Dagit, we can use the "Presets" selector.

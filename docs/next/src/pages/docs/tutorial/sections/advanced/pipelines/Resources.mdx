### Parametrizing Pipelines with Resources

Dagster models interactions with features of the external environment
like these as resources (and library modules such as `dagster_aws`,
`dagster_gcp`, and even `dagster_slack` provide out-of-the-box
implementations for many common external services).

Typically, your data processing pipelines will want to store their
results in a data warehouse somewhere separate from the raw data
sources. We'll adjust our toy pipeline so that it does a little more
work on our cereal dataset, stores the finished product in a swappable
data warehouse, and lets the team know when we're finished.

You might have noticed that our cereal dataset isn't normalized --
that is, the serving sizes for some cereals are as small as a quarter of
a cup, and for others are as large as a cup and a half. This grossly
understates the nutritional difference between our different cereals.

Let's transform our dataset and then store it in a normalized table in
the warehouse:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=59 emphasize-lines=18 caption=resources.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/resources.py
lines:59-82
```

Resources are another facility that Dagster makes available on the
`context` object passed to solid logic. Note that we've completely
encapsulated access to the database behind the call to
`context.resources.warehouse.update_normalized_cereals`. This means that
we can easily swap resource implementations -- for instance, to test
against a local SQLite database instead of a production Snowflake
database; to abstract software changes, such as swapping raw SQL for
SQLAlchemy; or to accomodate changes in business logic, like moving from
an overwriting scheme to append-only, date-partitioned tables.

To implement a resource and specify its config schema, we use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="resource" displayText="@resource" /> decorator. The decorated function should return whatever object you wish to make available under the specific resource's slot in
`context.resources`. Resource constructor functions have access to their
own `context` argument, which gives access to resource-specific config.
(Unlike the contexts we've seen so far, which are instances of <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemComputeExecutionContext" />, this
context is an instance of <PyObject module="dagster" object="InitResourceContext" />.)

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=17 emphasize-lines=28-30 caption=resources.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/resources.py
lines:17-46
```

The last thing we need to do is to attach the resource to our pipeline,
so that it's properly initialized when the pipeline run begins and made
available to our solid logic as `context.resources.warehouse`.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=85 emphasize-lines=2-6 caption=resources.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/resources.py
lines:85-94
```

All resources are associated with a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ModeDefinition" /> So far,
all of our pipelines have had only a single, system default mode, so we haven't had to tell Dagster what mode to run
them in. Even in this case, where we provide a single anonymous mode to
the <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" /> decorator,
we won't have to specify which mode to use (it will take the place of the `default` mode).

We can put it all together with the following config:

```YAML literalinclude emphasize-lines=1-4 caption=resources.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/resources.yaml
```

(Here, we pass the special string `":memory:"` in config as the
connection string for our database -- this is how SQLite designates an
in-memory database.)

<br />

#### Expressing Resource Dependencies

We've provided a `warehouse` resource to our pipeline, but we're still
manually managing our pipeline's dependency on this resource. Dagster
also provides a way for solids to advertise their resource requirements,
to make it easier to keep track of which resources need to be provided
for a pipeline.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=57 emphasize-lines=1 caption=required_resources.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/pipelines/required_resources.py
lines:57-80
```

Now, the Dagster machinery knows that this solid requires a resource
called `warehouse` to be present on its mode definitions, and will
complain if that resource is not present.

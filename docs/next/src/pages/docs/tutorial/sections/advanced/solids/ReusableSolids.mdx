### Reusable Solids

Solids are intended to abstract chunks of business logic, but
abstractions aren't very meaningful unless they can be reused.

Our conditional outputs pipeline included a lot of repeated code --
`sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and `sort_cold_cereals_by_calories`, for
instance. In general, it's preferable to build pipelines out of a
relatively restricted set of well-tested library solids, using config
liberally to parametrize them. (You'll certainly have your own version
of `read_csv`, for instance, and Dagster includes libraries like
`dagster_aws` and `dagster_spark` to wrap and abstract interfaces with
common third party tools.)

Let's replace `sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and
`sort_cold_cereals_by_calories` by two aliases of the same library
solid:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=56 emphasize-lines=17-18 caption=reusable_solids.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.py
lines:56-75
```

You'll see that Dagit distinguishes between the two invocations of the
single library solid and the solid's definition. The invocation is
named and bound via a dependency graph to other invocations of other
solids. The definition is the generic, resuable piece of logic that is
invoked many times within this pipeline.

Configuring solids also uses the aliases, as in the following YAML:

```YAML literalinclude emphasize-lines=6,8 caption=reusable_solids.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.yaml
```

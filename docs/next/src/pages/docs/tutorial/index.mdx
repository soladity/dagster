# Tutorial

If you're new to Dagster, we recommend working through this tutorial to become
familiar with Dagster's feature set and tooling, using small examples that are
intended to be illustrative of real data problems.

## Before We Start

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- [**Setup for the Tutorial**](/docs/tutorial/setup) will give you a starting point to follow the tutorial.
- [**Overview**](/docs/tutorial/overview) will teach you the fundamental concepts of Dagster: solids and pipelines.
- [**ETL with Dagster**](/docs/tutorial/basics) will teach you ways to construct and execute a simple data pipeline using
  the basics of Dagster.
- [**Advanced Tutorials**](/docs/tutorial/advanced) will showcase Dagster's advanced features like scheduling and materializations.

### What Are We Building

We'll build examples around a simple but scary .csv dataset, `cereal.csv`, which contains nutritional
facts about 80 breakfast cereals. You can find this dataset on
[Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagster-io/dagster/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv).
Or, if you've cloned the dagster git repository, you'll find this dataset at
`dagster/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv`

To get the flavor of this dataset, let's look at the header and the first five
rows:

```CSV literalinclude caption=cereal.csv
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv
lines:1-6
```

You can find all of the [tutorial code](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial)
checked into the dagster repository.

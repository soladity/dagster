# ETL with Dagster

We now have the basic building blocks for our cereal pipeline. To construct and execute a data
pipeline using Dagster, we will need solids as our computational units to contain business logics,
a pipeline to connect solids, and a way to execute the pipeline.

## Execute Our First Pipeline

Let's write our first Dagster pipeline.

## Making Your Pipelines Testable and Maintainable

The reality of building data applications is that they are notoriously difficult to test and are
therefore typically un- or under-tested. Besides, pipeline authors generally do not have control
over their input data, which led to an even more unfortunate reality — even if data pipelines are
covered by sophisticated tests, pipeline breakage could still happen.

Creating testable and verifiable data applications is one of the focuses of Dagster. We believe
ensuring data quality is critical for managing the complexity of data systems. This section will
talk about how you can build maintainable and testable data applications with Dagster.

Congratulations! Having reached this far, you now have a working, testable, and maintainable data pipeline. You’ve also learned the basics of Dagster, and you should now be able to build your own data applications using Dagster!

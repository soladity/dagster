# Advanced Tutorials

This section will introduce some advanced features and give you deeper insight into Dagster. It's worth reading if you have needs including things like

- Reusing the same solids over and over again
- Configuring pipeline-wide facilities to avoiding repeated code or config with unchanged business logic
- Persisting artifacts
- Scheduling data pipelines
- Better organizing multiple pipelines

## More about Solids

Abstracting business logic into reusable, configurable solids is one
important step towards making data applications like other software
applications.

## More about Pipelines

Pipelines often interact with external resources like Hadoop/Spark clusters or data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery. Dagster provides various facilities to avoid hard-coding interactions with such systems, so that your business logic can remain the same across local/test, dev, prod, etc. environments. Resources represent these external systems, and modes/presets support swapping resource implementations across different environments.

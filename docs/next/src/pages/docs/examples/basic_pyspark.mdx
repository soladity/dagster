# Running PySpark code in solids

The `pyspark` resource enables passing Spark configuration.  Solid bodies can use it to access
a `SparkSession` through its `spark_session` property.

Because PySpark has a lazy execution model, when the PySpark jobs execute depends on what
intermediate store is configured.  With the default in-memory intermediate store, the solids that
yield a DataFrame don't trigger execution, and the job won't run until an action, e.g. `count` in
the example is called on one of the DataFrames.

Alternatively, with a local filesystem intermediate store or S3 intermediate store, any solid outputs
that are DataFrames will be persisted to Parquet files.  This means that, with these intermediate
stores, the PySpark jobs execute immediately upon solid completion.

`dagster_pyspark.DataFrame`, which is a `DagsterType` knows how to save and load PySpark DataFrames.
`make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type` tells Dagster that when a solid has a return type
annotation for a, `pyspark.sql.DataFrame`, then Dagster should use the `dagster_pyspark.DataFrame`
to save and load it.

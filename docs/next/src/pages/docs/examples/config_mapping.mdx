# Config Mapping

This example demonstrates how to use config mapping in Dagster to simplify complicated solid config
schemas. Imagine you are launching many different invocations of a Spark job with similar cluster
configuration, you might need to write something like:

```YAML
solids:
  solid_a:
    config:
      driver_cores: 2
      driver_memory: "4g"
      num_executors: 4
      executor_cores: 4
      executor_memory: "8g"
      name: "job_a"
      args: ["--record-src", "foo"]

  solid_b:
    config:
      driver_cores: 2
      driver_memory: "4g"
      num_executors: 4
      executor_cores: 4
      executor_memory: "8g"
      name: "job_b"
      args: ["--record-src", "bar"]
  ...
```

As you can see, most of the configuration remains unchanged for `solid_a` and `solid_b`, and this
can get really tedious if you have hundreds of copies.

With config mapping, you can create a `@composite_solid` to wrap your complicated solid(s), pin the
shared config, and only expose `name` and `args` to users.

In this example, the `hello` solid has a complicated cluster config. With `hello_external`, we've
pre-configured the cluster config, and expose only a simplified config which we pass through to the
inner `hello` solid.

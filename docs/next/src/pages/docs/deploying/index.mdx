# Deploying Dagster

Deploying Dagster usually means:
- Setting up a [Dagster instance](/docs/overview/instances/dagster-instance), which is responsible for launching runs, storing logs and metadata from runs, and serving the Dagit UI.
- Optionally, setting up an [executor](/docs/overview/run-launchers-executors/executor), e.g. [Celery](/docs/deploying/celery) or [Dask](/docs/deploying/dask), for executing solids within runs.

# Asset Materializations

In Dagster, an `Asset` is the abstract representation of a data artifact produced and persisted by
a solid.  These assets are generally persisted to storage external to Dagster (e.g. database table,
analytics dashboard) as a side-effect of the solid's computation. The act of persisting an asset
is called a "materialization" and solids can express materializations by yielding a materialization
event.

## Materializing an Asset

To generate an asset materialization, we can yield a <PyObject module="dagster" object="Materialization" /> event in our solid.
This would involve changing the following solid:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
lineno-start:
lines:18-22
```

into something like this:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
lineno-start:
lines:25-30
```

Note: Our materialization solid must now explicitly yield an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
event instead of relying on the implicit conversion of the return value into an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
event.

We should now see a materialization event in the event log when we execute this solid.


## Attaching Metadata to the Asset Materialization

There are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with a materialization event, all
through the <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> class.  Each materialization
event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log.

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
lineno-start:
lines:33-47
```

Check our API docs for <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> for more details
on they types of event metadata available.

## Indexing with Asset Keys

Asset materializations can be indexed by adding an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetKey" />
to the materialization event.  The <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetKey" /> is a normalized,
structured identifier for an Asset.

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
lines:50-62
```

As soon as materialization events with asset keys are generated during pipeline execution, those
assets should appear in the `Assets` dashboard in `dagit`. With these indexed assets, we can now
explore the relationship between our units of computation (e.g. solids, pipelines) and the data they
produce (e.g. assets).  Specifically, that exploration can begin with the starting point of the
asset rather than from the pipeline.

# Deploying Dagster

Deploying Dagster usually means:

- Setting up a [Dagster instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance), which is responsible for launching runs, storing logs and metadata from runs, and serving the Dagit UI.
- Optionally, setting up an [executor](/overview/run-launchers-executors/executor), e.g. [Celery](/deploying/celery) or [Dask](/deploying/dask), for executing solids within runs.

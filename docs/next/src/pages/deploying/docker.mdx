# Deploying Dagster in Docker

If you are running on AWS ECS or another container-based orchestration system,
you'll likely want to package Dagit using a Docker image.

A minimal skeleton `Dockerfile` that will run Dagit is shown below:

```dockerfile literalinclude caption=Dockerfile
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/docker/Dockerfile
```

You'll also need to include a `dagster.yaml` file in the same directory as the Dockerfile to
configure the [Dagster instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) that Dagit will use:

```yaml literalinclude caption=dagster.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/docker/dagster.yaml
```

In cases where you're using environment variable to configure the instance, you should ensure these
environment variables are exposed in the running Dagit container.

In practice, you may want to volume mount your pipeline code into your containers to enable
deployment patterns such as git-sync sidecars that avoid the need to rebuild images and redeploy
containers when pipeline code changes.

Dagit servers expose a health check endpoint at `/dagit_info`, which returns a JSON response like:

```JSON
{
  "dagit_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_graphql_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_version": "0.6.6"
}
```

## Multi-container Docker deployment

More advanced dagster deployments will require deploying more than one container.
For example, if you are using [dagster-daemon](/overview/daemon) to run schedules and sensors or manage a queue of runs,
you'll likely want a separate container running the `dagster-daemon` service. Dagster also supports
a deployment setup where pipeline code can be updated and deployed separately in its own container,
without needing to redeploy the other dagster services.

A complete working example of this architecture using docker-compose can be found in
[this example](/examples/deploy_docker), which includes a dagit container, a dagster-daemon
container, and one or more containers with user pipeline code.

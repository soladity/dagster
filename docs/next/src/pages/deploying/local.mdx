# Running Dagit as a service

The core of any deployment of Dagster is a Dagit process that serves a user interface and responds
to GraphQL queries.

Ensure that you are running a recent Python version. Typically, you'll want to run Dagit inside a
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Then, you can install Dagit and any additional
libraries you might need.

```shell
pip install dagit
```

To run Dagit, use a command like the following:

```shell
DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home dagit -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

In this configuration, Dagit will write execution logs to `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs` and listen on
_0.0.0.0:3000_.

## Dagit in Docker

If you are running on AWS ECS, Kubernetes, or some other container-based orchestration system,
you'll likely want to package Dagit using a Docker image.

A minimal skeleton `Dockerfile` and entrypoint shell script that will run Dagit and the cron
scheduler are shown below:

```dockerfile literalinclude caption=Dockerfile
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/docker/Dockerfile
```

In this setup, the contents of `entrypoint.sh` should be something like the following. This script
ensures that cron will run in the Docker container alongside Dagit:

```bash literalinclude caption=entrypoint.sh
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/docker/entrypoint.sh
```

Finally, you should include a `dagster.yaml` file in `$DAGSTER_HOME` to configure the [Dagster
instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) that Dagit will use:

```yaml literalinclude caption=dagster.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/docker/dagster.yaml
```

In cases where you're using env vars to configure the instance database, you should ensure these
environment variables are exposed in the running Dagit container.

In practice, you may want to volume mount your pipeline code into your containers to enable
deployment patterns such as git-sync sidecars that avoid the need to rebuild images and redeploy
containers when pipeline code changes.

Dagit servers expose a health check endpoint at `/dagit_info`, which returns a JSON response like:

```JSON
{
  "dagit_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_graphql_version": "0.6.6",
  "dagster_version": "0.6.6"
}
```

## Non-Docker deployment using systemd

To run Dagit as a long-lived service, you can install a systemd service such as the following:

```bash literalinclude caption=dagit.service
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/systemd/dagit.service
```

Note that this assumes you've got a virtualenv for Dagster at `/opt/dagster/venv` and that your
pipeline code and `workspace.yaml` are located under `/opt/dagster/app`.

# Deploying to GCP

## Hosting Dagit on GCE

To host Dagit on a bare VM or in Docker on GCE, see [Running Dagit as a service](/deploying/local).

## Using Cloud SQL for run and event log storage

We recommend launching a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance for run and
events data. You can configure Dagit to use Cloud SQL to run and events
data by setting blocks in your `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`
appropriately:

```python literalinclude caption=dagster-pg.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/deploying/dagster-pg.yaml
```

In this case, you'll want to ensure you provide the right connection
strings for your Cloud SQL instance, and that the node or container
hosting Dagit is able to connect to Cloud SQL.

Be sure that this file is present, and _DAGSTER_HOME_ is
set, on the node where Dagit is running.

Note that using Cloud SQL for run and event log storage does not require
that Dagit be running in the cloud. If you are connecting a local Dagit
instance to a remote Cloud SQL storage, double check that your local
node is able to connect to Cloud SQL.

## Using GCS for intermediates storage

You'll probably also want to configure a GCS bucket to store
intermediates. This enables reexecution, review and audit of
intermediate results, and cross-node cooperation (e.g., with the
multiprocessing or Dagster celery executors).

You'll first need to add GCS storage to your **`ModeDefinition`**

```python
from dagster_gcp.gcs.resources import gcs_resource
from dagster_gcp.gcs.intermediate_storage import gcs_plus_default_intermediate_storage_defs
from dagster import ModeDefinition

prod_mode = ModeDefinition(
    name='prod',
    intermediate_storage_defs=gcs_plus_default_intermediate_storage_defs,
    resource_defs={'gcs': gcs_resource}
)
```

Then, just add the following YAML to your pipeline config:

```yaml
intermediate_storage:
  gcs:
    config:
      gcs_bucket: your-gcs-bucket-name
```

With this in place, your pipeline runs will store intermediates on GCS
in the location
`gs://<bucket>/dagster/storage/<pipeline run id>/intermediates/<solid name>.compute`

# Troubleshooting queued runs

Below are some possible issues that you can run in to with [limiting run concurrency](/overview/pipeline-runs/limiting-run-concurrency) using the [QueuedRunCoordinator](/overview/pipeline-runs/run-coordinator#queuedruncoordinator).

## Runs skip the `QUEUED` status, going straight to `STARTED`

This likely means that you are not using the [QueuedRunCoordinator](/overview/pipeline-runs/run-coordinator#queuedruncoordinator), which is responsible for run queuing. You can check the run coordinator on your instance in Dagit by going to `Status` -> `Configuration`.

## Runs are not being dequeued

If your runs stay in the `QUEUED` status, the issue is likely either that the [Dagster Daemon](/overview/daemon) is not deployed on your instance, or that the queue configuration is blocking your runs.

### Step 1: Check that the Dagster Daemon is running on your instance

In Dagit, go to `Status` -> `HEALTH`, and check that the `Run queue` is healthy. If not:

#### Is the Daemon running at all?

Run queuing depends on the Daemon. See the [Daemon Overview](/overview/daemon) for how to set it up on your instance.

#### Is the Daemon accessing the same storages as the Dagit process?

If you have started a Daemon process, you should make sure that the Daemon is accessing the same storages as the Dagit process, meaning both processes should be using the same `dagster.yaml`. Locally, this means both processes should have the same `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable set. See the [Dagster Instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) docs for more information.

### Step 2: Check your queue configuration

If the Daemon is running on your instance, it may be the case that runs are intentionally being left in the queue due to concurrency rules. It may be helpful to look at the logged output from the Daemon process, as this will indicate when runs are skipped.

The run queue is configured in the `dagster.yaml` under `run_coordinator`. This can be viewed in Dagit via `Status` -> `Configuration`. Runs may be staying in `QUEUED` due to rules here. The most basic rule that would block the queue would be `max_concurrent_runs: 0`. In more practical cases, the queue will be blocked by some number of in progress runs. To understand the state of your run queue, it's helpful to view both the 'Queued' and 'In Progress' tabs of the Dagit run page.

#### Unblocking the queue

If there are runs in progress that are blocking the queue, you have the option of terminating them via Dagit so that other runs can proceed.

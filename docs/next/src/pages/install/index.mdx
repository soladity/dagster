# Quick start

To install Dagster and Dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python
environment.

Dagster is tested on Python 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, and 2.7.

Using Python 3 is strongly encouraged, as the [official
EOL](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) for Python 2 was January 1, 2020.

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment, you can
run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If you are running Anaconda,
you should install Dagster inside a Conda environment.

If you would like to install Dagster from source, please see the section on
[Contributing](/community/contributing).

## Telemetry

As an open source project, we collect usage statistics to better understand how users engage with
Dagster and to inform development priorities. Telemetry data will motivate projects such as adding
functionality in frequently-used parts of the CLI and will help us understand adoption of new
features.

We will not see or store any data that is processed within solids and pipelines. We will not see or
store solid definitions (including generated context) or pipeline definitions (including modes and
resources).

The telemetry-instrumented functions are:

```python literalinclude showLines caption=telemetry.py
file:../python_modules/dagster/dagster/core/telemetry.py
lines:52-56
```

To see the logs we send, open `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs/` if `$DAGSTER_HOME` is set or `~/.dagster/logs/`
if not set (after calling the instrumented functions).

If you'd like to opt-out, you can add the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` (creating that
file if necessary):

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```

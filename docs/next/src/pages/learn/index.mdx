# Learn

If you're brand new to the Dagster system, we recommend starting with
the [tutorial](/tutorial), which will walk you through the
most important concepts in Dagster step by step.

The Guides provide deep dives into major areas of the system, motivated
by common data engineering and data science workflows

  - [Dagster Types](/learn/guides/dagster_types)
  - [Solid Guide](/learn/guides/solid/solid)
  - [Partitioning and Scheduling Guide](/learn/guides/partitioning)
  - [Testing Guide](/learn/guides/testing/testing)
  - [Data Quality Tests](/learn/guides/testing/expectations)
  - [Logging Guide](/learn/guides/logging/logging)
  - [Data Science with Notebooks](/learn/guides/data_science/data_science)
  - [Validating Pandas DataFrames with Dagster Types](/learn/guides/dagster_pandas/dagster_pandas)

The How-Tos provide easily digestable short answers to common questions
about Dagster

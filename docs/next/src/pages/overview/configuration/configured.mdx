# Configured API

In many cases, the option to configure an entity at runtime is more distracting than helpful, and
it's preferable to supply the entity's configuration at definition time.

The `configured` API offers a way to do this. When invoked on a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" />, <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExecutorDefinition" />, <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition" />, <PyObject module="dagster" object="CompositeSolidDefinition" />, or <PyObject module="dagster" object="LoggerDefinition" />,
it returns an interchangeable object with the given configuration "baked in".

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/configuration/configured_example.py
```

In other cases, it's useful to partially fill out configuration at definition time and leave other
configuration for runtime. For these cases, `configured` can be used as a decorator, accepting a
function that translates from runtime config to config that satisfies the entity's config schema.
It returns an entity with the "outer" config schema as its schema.

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/configuration/config_map_example.py
```

The `configured` API can be used with any definition type in the same way. To configure a solid, for
example, simply invoke `configured` on the solid definition:

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/configuration/configured_solid_example.py
```

When using the decorator syntax (`@configured`), the resulting solid definition will inherit the
name of the function being decorated (like `another_configured_example` in the above example). When
configuring a solid completely with a config dictionary rather than with a function (as with
`configured_example`), you must add the positional argument `name` in the call to `configured`.
When naming solids, remember that solid definitions must have unique names within a repository or
pipeline.

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/configuration/configured_named_solid_example.py
startBefore: start_configured_named
endAfter: end_configured_named
```

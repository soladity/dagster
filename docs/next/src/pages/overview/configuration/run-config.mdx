# Configuration

## Run Config

Several dimensions of pipeline execution can be determined at execution time through configuration.
We call this set of chosen values **run config**. The run config is passed as a dictionary in the python api
or as a yaml document when using `dagit` or the CLI. The following top level keys in the run config allow you to
configure different aspects:

- **execution**: Determine and configure the <PyObject module="dagster" object="Executor" /> to be used to control
  execution of the pipeline.

- **storage**: Determine and configure the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemStorageDefinition" /> to be
  used to control how data is persisted as it is handed off from solid to solid.

- **loggers** : Determine and configure the <PyObject module="dagster" object="LoggerDefinition" /> to be
  used when logging.

- **solids** : Configure solids that belong to the pipeline. In addition to providing values for solid specific configuration,
  inputs may also be configured here, when dependencies on upstream solids outputs have not been set in the pipeline.

- **resources** : Configure resources that belong to the pipeline that have defined configuration schema.

## Configuration Schema

The Dagster library includes a system for defining the schema that configuration values must abide by.
The most common objects to specify <PyObject module="dagster" object="ConfigSchema" /> for
are <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" />.

The following simple example shows how **config_schema** can be used on a solid to control its behavior:

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/configuration/example.py
```

While the example above uses simple scalar config values, the config system supports structured types allowing for
complex configuration. These are [documented in the API section with examples](/_apidocs/config).

Notable entries include:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Field" /> - the basic building block
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Shape" /> - for well defined dictionaries
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Permissive" /> - for allowing untyped dictionaries
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Selector" /> - to allow choosing one of N
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="StringSource" /> - to allow loading from environment
  variables

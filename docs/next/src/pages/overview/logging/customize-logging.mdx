# Customize Loggers

You may find yourself wanting to add or supplement the built-in loggers so that Dagster logs
are integrated with the rest of your log aggregation and monitoring infrastructure.

For example, you may be operating in a containerized environment where container stdout is
aggregated by a tool such as Logstash. In this kind of environment, where logs will be aggregated
and parsed by machine, the multi-line output from the default colored console logger is unhelpful.
Instead, we'd much prefer to see single-line, structured log messages like:

```json
{"orig_message": "Hello, world!", "log_message_id": "49854579-e4d1-4289-8453-b3e177b20056", ...}
```

In fact, a logger that prints JSON-formatted single-line messages like this to the console is
already included as `dagster.loggers.json_console_logger`. But let's look at how we might
implement a simplified version of this logger.

Loggers are defined internally using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="LoggerDefinition" displayText="LoggerDefinition" />
class, but, following a common pattern in the Dagster codebase, the <PyObject module="dagster" object="logger" displayText="@logger" />
decorator exposes a simpler API for the common use case and
is typically what you'll use to define your own loggers. The decorated function should take a single
argument, the `init_context` available during logger initialization, and return a `logging.Logger`.

```python literalinclude caption=custom_logger.py showLines
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/logging/custom_logger.py
```

As you can see, you can specify the logger name in the run config. It also takes a `config` argument,
representing the config that users can pass to the logger, for example:

```yaml literalinclude caption=config_custom_logger.yaml showLines emphasize-lines=2-4
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/logging/config_custom_logger.yaml
```

When you execute the pipeline, you'll notice that you are no longer using the built-in logger but
your custom json logger instead.

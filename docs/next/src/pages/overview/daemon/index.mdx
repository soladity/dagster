# Dagster Daemon

Several Dagster features, like [schedules](/overview/schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/overview/schedules-sensors/sensors),
and run queueing, require a long-running `dagster-daemon` process to be included
with your deployment.

To run the `dagster-daemon` process locally, simply run the following command on the same
machine that you use to run Dagit:

```shell
dagster-daemon run
```

Check the [Deploying](/deploying) section for more information on how to deploy the daemon in
other environments, like Docker or Kubernetes.

## Available daemons

The `dagster-daemon` process reads from your [Dagster instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) file to
determine which daemons it should include. Each of those daemons then executes on a regular interval.
The following daemons are currently available:

- The _scheduler daemon_ is responsible for create runs rom any [schedules](/overview/schedules-sensors/schedules) that
  are turned on. This daemon will run as long as you don't have a scheduler other than <PyObject module="dagster.core.scheduler" object="DagsterDaemonScheduler" />
  set as the scheduler on your instance.

- The _run queue daemon_ is responsible for launching queued runs, using any limits and prioritization
  rules you've set on your instance. You can enable this daemon by setting the run coordinator on your
  instance to <PyObject module="dagster.core.run_coordinator" object="QueuedRunCoordinator" />.

- The _sensor daemon_ is responsible for executing the evaluation function of any running
  [sensors](/overview/schedules-sensors/sensors) on your instance. This daemon is always enabled.

## Daemons in Dagit

To check the status of your `dagster-daemon` process within Dagit, click on "Status" in the left nav.
This will take you a page where you can see information about each daemon that's currently configured on your instance.

Each daemon periodically writes a heartbeat to your instance storage, so if a daemon doesn't show a
recent heartbeat on this page, it likely indicates that you should check the logs on your `dagster-daemon`
process for errors.

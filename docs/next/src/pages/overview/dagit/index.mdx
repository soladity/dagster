# Dagit

Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

Through it, you can inspect solid and pipeline definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and
view assets produced by those runs.

To launch the Dagit web server, run `dagit`.  The command will print out the URL you can access the
interface from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

Dagit fetches definitions - pipelines, solids, schedules, partition sets - from a set of
repositories configured in a `workspace.yaml`.  It fetches runs from a run storage, configured in
an instance's `dagster.yaml`.  It fetches assets from an asset storage, also configured in an
instance's `dagster.yaml`.

These are the main pages inside Dagit:

## Pipeline

The Pipeline page lets you explore a pipeline definition, launch a pipeline run, and examine a
pipeline run.

### Pipeline definition

The Definition tab in the pipeline page shows the topology of solids that make up a
pipeline.  Selecting a solid reveals detailed metadata about it in the right pane.

### Playground

The Playground tab in the pipeline page lets you experiment with configuration and launch runs.  You
can select from the set of presets for the pipeline, or type in your own configuration in the
editor.

### Run

The Run tab in the pipeline page lets you see what happened within a single pipeline run. The upper
left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each solid took to execute. The bottom pane
shows events and logs emitted during the course of execution. The "Launch Re-execution" button
lets you kick off a new run with the same configuration as the displayed run.

# Expectation Results

In Dagster, solids can emit structured events to represent the results of a data quality test. The
data quality event class is the <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" />. To
generate an expectation result, we can yield an <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" /> event
in our solid.

This would involve changing the following solid:

```python literalinclude caption=expectation.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/expectation_solids.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_expectation_solids_marker_0
endBefore:end_expectation_solids_marker_0
```

into something like this:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/expectation_solids.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_expectation_solids_marker_1
endBefore:end_expectation_solids_marker_1
```

## Attaching Metadata to the Expectation Result

Much like materialization events, there are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated
with an expectation result event, all through the <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> class.
Each expectation event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the
event log.

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/expectation_solids.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_metadata
endBefore:end_metadata
```

Check our API docs for <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> for more details
on they types of event metadata available.

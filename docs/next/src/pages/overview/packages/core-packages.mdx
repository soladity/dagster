## Core packages

Dagster is a highly componentized system built around a few core
packages:

**dagster**

Contains the core programming model, which you'll use to write
solids, pipelines, and all the other components of a data
application, as well as the `dagster` CLI tool for executing and
managing pipelines. Every Dagster project starts here and will
import from the public API of this library.

**dagit**

Our GUI tool for visualizing, testing, scheduling, running, and
monitoring Dagster pipelines, written against the GraphQL API.
You'll use Dagit locally to develop and monitor pipelines, as well
as in production for long-running deployments.

**dagster-graphql**

Defines a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API for executing
pipelines and includes a CLI tool for executing queries against the
API. Users will typically not make imports from this package, but
tools like Dagit, integrations like dagster-airflow, and some
containerization strategies are all built on the GraphQL API. Most
users should not install this package directly

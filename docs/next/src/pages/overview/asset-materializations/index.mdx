# Asset Catalog

"Asset" is Dagster's word for an entity, external to solids, that is mutated or created by solids.  An asset might be a table in a database that solids append to, an ML model in a model store that solids overwrite, or even a slack channel that solids write messages to.

The Asset Catalog is an interface inside [Dagit](/overview/dagit) that centers on assets.  Each entry in the catalog is an asset and includes:
* Runs that mutated or created the asset
* Metadata logged by developers about the asset

Developers place entries in the Asset Catalog by yielding <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> events from inside their solids or [output managers](/overview/io-managers/io-managers).  The act of mutating or creating an asset is called a "materialization".  <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> events may include arbitrary metadata that describes the asset at the time of the materialization.

There are two general patterns for dealing with assets when using Dagster:
* Materialize assets from inside the body of a solid.
* Focus solid on pure business logic, and delegate the materialization of assets to IOManagers.

## Recording Asset Materializations in Solids

To make the Asset Catalog aware that we materialized an asset in our solid, we can yield an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> event.
This would involve changing the following solid:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization_solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
startAfter:start_materialization_solids_marker_0
endBefore:end_materialization_solids_marker_0
```

into something like this:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization_solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
startAfter:start_materialization_solids_marker_1
endBefore:end_materialization_solids_marker_1
```

Note: Our materialization solid must now explicitly yield an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
event instead of relying on the implicit conversion of the return value into an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
event.

We should now see a materialization event in the event log when we execute this solid, as well as an entry in the asset catalog.

## Recording Asset Materializations in Output Managers

To record that an OutputManager or IOManager has mutated or created an asset, we can yield an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> event from its `handle_output` method.

```python literalinclude caption=materialization_asset_stores.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_asset_stores.py
startAfter:start_marker_0
endBefore:end_marker_0
```

## Attaching Metadata to the Asset Materialization

There are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with a materialization event, all
through the <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> class. Each materialization
event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log and the asset catalog.

Example with a solid:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_solids.py
startAfter:start_materialization_solids_marker_2
endBefore:end_materialization_solids_marker_2
```

Example with an IOManager:

```python literalinclude caption=materialization_asset_stores.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/asset_materializations/materialization_asset_stores.py
startAfter:start_marker_1
endBefore:end_marker_1
```

Check our API docs for <PyObject module="dagster" object="EventMetadataEntry" /> for more details
on they types of event metadata available.

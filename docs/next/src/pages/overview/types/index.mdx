# Dagster Types

The Dagster type system helps users describe what kind of values their solids accept and produce. Each solid input and output can be annotated with a <PyObject module="dagster" object="DagsterType" />.

The type system is _gradual_ and
_optional_ - pipelines can run without types specified explicitly, and specifying types in some places doesn't require that types be specified everywhere. Inputs and outputs default to the <PyObject module="dagster" object="Any" /> type.

The Dagster type system is independent from the [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) Python type
system, although we overload the type annotation syntax on functions to
make it easier to specify the input and output types of your solids.

Dagster type-checking happens at solid execution time - each type defines a `type_check_fn` that knows how to check whether values match what it expects. When a type is specified for a solid's input, then the type check occurs immediately before the solid is executed. When a type is specified for a solid's output, then the type check occurs immediately after the solid is executed.

## DagsterType

The core API for defining Dagster types is <PyObject module="dagster" object="DagsterType" />.

```python literalinclude caption=test_type_guide.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:28-31
```

Once created, types can be attached to solid <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" />s and <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" />s.

```python literalinclude caption=types_on_definitions.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:51-56
```

Using Python 3 and type annotations, the same declaration can be
expressed as:

```python literalinclude caption=type_annotations.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:33-35
```

When raw DagsterTypes are passed, this is not compliant with mypy or
other python static type-checking system (we will refer to just mypy
throughout the remainder of this document for convenience). We detail
how to do that later in this document.

### Scalars

Dagster exports top level scalars -- `Int`, `Bool`, `String`, `Float`
-- that can be used as DagsterType instances. For convenience, one can
use the corresponding python built-in scalars -- `int`, `bool`, `str`,
`float` -- to specify the corresponding Dagster scalar types. This also
makes these arguments mypy-compliant. There is a 1:1 relationship
between the python type -- e.g. `int` -- and its corresponding dagster
type -- e.g. `dagster.Int` and a mapping between them is maintained by
the system. This means that those python types can be used in
InputDefinitions or OutputDefinitions. If passed as type annotation to
solids, the corresponding DagsterType will also be picked up by the
system.

As we will see later, the user can also define their own 1:1
relationships between python and Dagster types.

## PythonObjectDagsterType

It is common to define
types that just do _isinstance_ checks as the Dagster type
check. <PyObject module="dagster" object="PythonObjectDagsterType" /> does just that.

```python literalinclude caption=python_object_dagster_type.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:67-72
```

One can now declare the Dagster type as the interface to the solid, and
use the corresponding python type in business logic.

```python literalinclude caption=dagster_type_annotations.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:74-80
```

The type system truly shines once the
type check expresses richer behavior, such as column-level schema on a
dataframe. The dagster-pandas library offers that capability through <PyObject module="dagster_pandas" object="create_dagster_pandas_dataframe_type" />.

## Loading from Config

When executing a pipeline or
solid whose data are not produced by a dependency - e.g. for a
solid at the beginning of a pipeline or execution subset - the data
needs to come from somewhere. This can be specified by config.

The type must declare its interaction with the config system. This means
declaring the input schema and a function which the validated config
value and produces a valid in-memory value to be passed to the schema.
This process is referred to as loading.

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:86-99
```

With this the input can be specified via config as below:

```python literalinclude
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:101-108
```

Output values can also be materialized to a user-controlled location
using config in a similar fashion.

## Dagster Type Use Cases

Inputs and Outputs can represent, via the type system:

1.  **In-Memory-Data**: In-memory data that is either produced a
    previous computation or specified via configuration. Dagster
    infrastructure -- the intermediates store -- handles the
    serialization the transfer between of these data in cases whereas
    multiple processes or nodes are being used to run the orchestration
    cluster.
2.  **Metadata**: Metadata about data that is managed by the user but
    not the intermediates store. The type system would ensure that the
    in-memory metadata format is correct and that any preconditions
    about the in situ data are met. An example of this would be a data
    lake with a user-defined URL scheme.
3.  **Preconditions**: Preconditions about external state necessary for
    computation to succeed. An example of this is a hard-coded database
    table name.
4.  **Execution Ordering**: In some pipelines there is no data to pass
    in between solids and there are no preconditions. This is a common
    in cases where one is migrating workflows from other systems --
    that do not have this concept -- to dagster, or where the upstream
    solids are purely operational whose effects are difficult or awkward
    to model. For these cases we offer the `Nothing` type.

## Python Types and Dagster Types

As alluded to earlier, the user can create define their own 1:1
relationships between Dagster types and Python types, making the
corresponding python type usable where the Dagster type is expected.

This is convenient when one has business objects that require nothing
more than an `isinstance` check in the Dagster type check _and_ one
wishes to use them both in type annotations directly and as business
objects. These type definitions reduce boilerplate as well as deliver
out-of-the-box mypy compliance.

There are two APIs: <PyObject module="dagster" object="usable_as_dagster_type" displayText="usable_as_dagster_type()" /> -- for
direct annotations of class declarations -- and <PyObject module="dagster" object="make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type" displayText="make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type()" /> -- for
mapping _existing_ classes. This is designed for importing python types libraries that cannot be altered and mapping them
to Dagster types.

```python literalinclude caption=usable_as_dagster_type.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:267-277
```

And make_python_type_usable_as_dagster_type

```python literalinclude caption=hello_cereal.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:281-294
```

This approach does have downsides. Importing these types will causes a
global side effect as there is an internal registry which manages these
types. This can introduce challenges in terms of testability and also
can causes in behavior based on import order.

Additionally some of the most useful patterns in the ecosystem are to
use type factories to programmatically create Dagster types, such as in
our dagster-pandas module. In these cases a 1:1 mapping between dagster
type and python type _no longer exists_. E.g. in dagster-pandas the
python representation for all the dataframe variants is simply
_pandas.DataFrame_.

For clearly scoped business objects, the reduction in boilerplate is
significant and eases mypy compliance, hence its inclusion in the public
Dagster API.

We do _not_ recommend that libraries use this pattern and instead rely
on other techniques to achieve mypy compliance.

### MyPy Compliance

Users who do not use "usable-as-dagster" python types types by choice
or necessity and who desire mypy compliance need additional support.

This is a challenge to do elegantly in light of the fact that, as of mypy
0.761, there is no way to directly annotate a object to treat it as a
type during a type checking pass. However there is a way to do this.

```python literalinclude caption=type_checking_mypy_compliance.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets_tests/intro_tutorial_tests/test_type_guide.py
lineno-start:1
lines:162-174
```

While not particularly elegant, this does work. We recommend
centralizing type definitions so that this style of definition is
compartmentalized to a single file.

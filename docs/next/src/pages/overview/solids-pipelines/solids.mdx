# Solids

The core abstraction of Dagster is the _solid_. A solid is a functional unit of computation. It has defined inputs and
outputs, and multiple solids can be wired together to form a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PipelineDefinition" displayText="Pipeline" /> by
defining dependencies between solid inputs and outputs.

A solid has a number of properties:

- Coarse-grained and for use in batch computations.
- Defines inputs and outputs, optionally typed within the Dagster type system.
- Embeddable in a dependency graph (pipeline) that is constructed by connecting the inputs and outputs of
  multiple solids.
- Emits a stream of typed, structured events &mdash; such as expectations and materializations &mdash;
  corresponding to the semantics of its computation.
- Exposes self-describing, strongly typed configuration.
- Testable and reusable.

## Defining a solid

There are two ways to define a solid:

1.  Wrap a python function in the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator
    _\[Preferred\]_
2.  Construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition"/> object

**Method 1: Using the decorator**

To use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator,
wrap a function that takes a `context` argument as the first
parameter. The context is provides access to system information such as
resources and solid configuration. See [Solid Context](#solid-context) for more information.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/solids_pipelines/solid_definition.py
lineno-start:
lines:6-8
```

**Method 2: Constructing the SolidDefinition object**

To construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition"/> object,
you need to pass the constructor a solid name,
input definitions, output definitions, and a `compute_fn`. The compute
function is the same as the function you would decorate using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/solids_pipelines/solid_definition.py
lines:11-17
```

## Solid inputs and outputs

Dependencies between solids in Dagster are defined using <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitions" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" displayText="OutputDefinitions" />.
Input and Output definitions are:

- Named
- Optionally typed
- Optionally have human readable descriptions

_Inputs:_

Inputs are arguments to a solid's `compute_fn`, and are specified using <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitionss" />.
They can be passed from outputs of other solids, or stubbed using config.

A solid only executes once all of its inputs have been resolved, which
means that the all of the outputs that the solid depends on have been
successfully yielded.

The argument names of the `compute_fn` must match the <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitionss" /> names,
and must be in the same order after the context argument.

For example, if we wanted a solid with an input of type `str` and an input of type `int`:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:25-27
```

_Outputs:_

Outputs are yielded from a solid's `compute_fn`. A solid can yield
multiple outputs.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:30-36
```

## Solid context

A context object is passed as the first parameter to a solid's
`compute_fn`. The context is an instance of <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemComputeExecutionContext" />,
and provides access to:

- solid configuration (`context.solid_config`)
- loggers (`context.log`)
- resources (`context.resources`)
- run ID (`context.run_id`)

For example, to access the logger

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:20-22
```

# Solid Events

A solid can yield a stream of events within its `compute_fn` to
communicate with the Dagster framework. These events must be one of the
following types:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Failure" /> (meant to be raised)

To return an output from a solid, simply `yield` an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> event:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
startAfter:my_yield_solid_start
endBefore:my_yield_solid_end
```

Many solids yield only one output, like the example above. Returning a
single value from a solid's `compute_fn` is equivalent to yielding a
single <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> event
with the default output name "result". For example:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
startAfter:return_and_yield_start
endBefore:return_and_yield_end
```

Note that you cannot `yield` a single value without wrapping it in <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />.
This is because a solid can yield arbitrarily many values, and there's no way
for the system to tell which one the author of the solid meant to use as
its output. For example:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
startAfter:incorrect_solid_start
endBefore:incorrect_solid_end
```

If you want to have multiple outputs for a solid, you cannot return
anything from the solid. Instead, you need to `yield` multiple <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> events,
each of which is named and defined on `output_defs` to prevent ambiguity:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
startAfter:multi_output_solid_start
endBefore:multi_output_solid_end
```

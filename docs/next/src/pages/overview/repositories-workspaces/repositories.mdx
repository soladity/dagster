# Repositories

Dagster provides the concept of a repository, a collection of pipelines and other definitions that
various tools, such as the Dagster CLI or Dagit, can target to load the definitions. Repositories are
declared using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="RepositoryDefinition" /> API as follows:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=24 caption=repos.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/repositories_workspaces/repository_definition.py
startAfter:start_repository_definition_marker_0
endBefore:end_repository_definition_marker_0
```

You can return a list of items, each one of which can be a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PipelineDefinition"/>,

<PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />, or <PyObject
  module="dagster"
  object="PartitionSetDefinition"
/>. If you save this file as `repos.py`, you can then run the command line tools
on it. Try running:

```bash
dagit -f repos.py
```

## Lazy Construction

Notice that this requires eager construction of all its member definitions. In large codebases,
pipeline construction time can be large. In these cases, it may behoove you to only construct them
on demand. For that, you can also return a dictionary of function references, which are constructed
on demand:

```python literalinclude showLines caption=repos.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/repositories_workspaces/lazy_repository_definition.py
startAfter:start_lazy_repository_definition_marker_0
endBefore:end_lazy_repository_definition_marker_0
```

Note that the name of the pipeline in the `RepositoryDefinition` must match the name we declared for
it in its `pipeline` (the default is the function name). Don't worry, if these names don't match,
you'll see a helpful error message.

# Sensors

Sensors allow you to instigate runs when some external state changes. For example, you might
want to launch a run whenever a new file appears in an S3 bucket, or when an asset is materialized
by another Dagster pipeline.

Each sensor:

- Targets a pipeline
- Defines an evaluation function that yields a number of `RunRequest` objects, each corresponding to a requested pipeline run
- Optionally defines `mode` and `solid_selection` for the target pipeline

## Defining a Sensor

To create a sensor, define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorDefinition"/> and include it in your repository.

The core of a sensor definition is the evaluation function. This function checks some external state
and yields a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> for each pipeline run that should be executed.
Each <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> consists a run config, a tags dictionary, and a run key string.

The [dagster-daemon](/overview/daemon) process is responsible for periodically invoking the
evaluation function for each of your running sensors (by default, every 30 seconds), and launching
runs from any <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/>s that are returned.

### Example sensor

For example, consider a pipeline that takes a filepath as input and logs it:

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_2
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_2
```

Below is a sensor that iterates through the contents of a directory and kicks off a job for each file that exists in the directory.

```python literalinclude caption=sensor.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/sensor_definition.py
startAfter:start_sensor_marker_0
endBefore:end_sensor_marker_0
```

Adding a new file to the directory will cause a new run for that file to be created the next time that the sensor is evaluated.

### Idempotence using run keys

In the above example, we use the `run_key` parameter to enforce idempotence for each filename.
Dagster will ensure that only one run is created for each unique `run_key` value for a given
sensor. In the example, even though the full directory contents are requested on every sensor
evaluation, only new files will actually instigate new runs due to the run key.

Run keys enable a sensor evaluation function to declaratively describe what runs should exist,
rather than keeping track of cursors or timestamps. However, the `last_run_key` and
`last_completion_time` attributes on the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorExecutionContext" /> that's passed into
the sensor evaluation function can also be used to keep track of timestamps and cursors.

### Sensors in Dagit

You can view and operate sensors in Dagit. To view the sensors page, click the "All sensors" button
in the left-hand navigation pane.

Here, we can turn sensors on and off, and also see past executions of each sensor.

### Testing sensors on the command-line

The `dagster` command-line tool contains a number of options to manage sensors. You can view the set of known sensors, turn them on and off, and preview the set of runs that will be requested in the next evaluation of the sensor.

You can view the full set of sensor command-line options by running `dagster sensor --help`.

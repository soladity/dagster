# Sensors

Sensors allow you to instigate runs when some external state changes. For example, you might
want to launch a run whenever a new file appears in an S3 bucket, or when an asset is materialized
by another Dagster pipeline.

Each sensor:

- Targets a pipeline
- Defines an evaluation function that yields a number of `RunRequest` objects, each corresponding to a requested pipeline run
- Optionally defines `mode` and `solid_selection` for the target pipeline

## Defining a Sensor

To create a sensor, define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorDefinition"/> and include it in your repository.

The core of a sensor definition is the evaluation function. This function checks some external state
and yields a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> for each pipeline run that should be executed.
Each <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> consists a run config, a tags dictionary, and a run key string.

The [dagster-daemon](/overview/daemon) process is responsible for periodically invoking the
evaluation function for each of your running sensors (by default, every 30 seconds), and launching
runs from any <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/>s that are returned.

### Example sensor

For example, consider a pipeline that takes a filepath as input and logs it:

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_2
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_2
```

Below is a sensor that iterates through the contents of a directory and kicks off a job for each file that exists in the directory.

```python literalinclude caption=sensor.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/sensor_definition.py
startAfter:start_sensor_marker_0
endBefore:end_sensor_marker_0
```

Adding a new file to the directory will cause a new run for that file to be created the next time that the sensor is evaluated.

### Idempotence using run keys

In the above example, we use the `run_key` parameter to enforce idempotence for each filename.
Dagster will ensure that only one run is created for each unique `run_key` value for a given
sensor. In the example, even though the full directory contents are requested on every sensor
evaluation, only new files will actually instigate new runs due to the run key.

Run keys enable a sensor evaluation function to declaratively describe what runs should exist,
rather than keeping track of cursors or timestamps. However, the `last_run_key` and
`last_completion_time` attributes on the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorExecutionContext" /> that's passed into
the sensor evaluation function can also be used to keep track of timestamps and cursors.

### Sensors in Dagit

You can view and operate sensors in Dagit. To view the sensors page, click the "All sensors" button
in the left-hand navigation pane.

Here, we can turn sensors on and off, and also see past executions of each sensor.

### Testing sensors on the command-line

The `dagster` command-line tool contains a number of options to manage sensors. You can view the set of known sensors, turn them on and off, and preview the set of runs that will be requested in the next evaluation of the sensor.

You can view the full set of sensor command-line options by running `dagster sensor --help`.

### Custom evaluation intervals

By default, sensors are configured to run roughly every 30 seconds. This is determined by two
factors: the minimum interval specified on the sensor definition, and the sensor daemon
configuration. The minimum interval specified on the sensor definition guarantees that the sensor
will not be evaluated at more frequently than that interval. The daemon interval determines how
often the daemon checks to see if any of the running sensors in the workspace have satisfied the
minimum interval.

In practice, the frequency at which any particular sensor will be evaluated equals the minimum
multiple of the daemon interval that is larger than or equal to the individual sensor's minimum
interval.

For example, here are two sensors that are defined with two different intervals:

```python literalinclude caption=sensor.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/sensor_definition.py
startAfter:start_sensor_marker_1
endBefore:end_sensor_marker_1
```

If we keep the same default of 30 seconds for the sensor daemon interval, the sensor daemon will
check to see if `sensor_A` and `sensor_B` have satisfied their minimum interval requirements. It
will see that `sensor_A` has satisfied it and evaluate its function. It will see that `sensor_B`
has not and will wait until the next loop to evaluate it. This means that the effective interval
for sensor evaluations is 30 seconds for `sensor_A` and 60 seconds for `sensor_B`.

We can adjust the sensor daemon configuration in our `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml literalinclude caption=dagster.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/dagster.yaml
```

Now, the effective interval for each sensor should be 30 seconds and 45 seconds, respectively.

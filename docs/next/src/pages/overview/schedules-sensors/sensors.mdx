# Sensors

Dagster enables sensors capable of instigating runs based on some external state change, e.g. executing a pipeline when a new file appears in an S3 bucket.
To create a sensor, define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorDefinition"/> and include it in your repository.

A sensor has a number of properties:

- Targets a pipeline
- Defines an evaluation function that yields a number of `RunRequest` objects, each corresponding to a requested pipeline run
- Optionally defines `mode` and `solid_selection` for the target pipeline

## Defining a Sensor

The core of a sensor definition is the evaluation function. The evaluation function checks some external state and yields a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> for each pipeline run that should be executed.
Each <PyObject module="dagster" object="RunRequest"/> consists a run config, a tags dictionary, and a run key string.

### Example pipeline

For example, we have a pipeline that takes in a filepath and logs it:

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_2
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_2
```

### Example sensor

You can create a sensor that lists the contents of a directory and kicks off a job for each file that exists in the directory.

```python literalinclude caption=sensor.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/sensor_definition.py
startAfter:start_sensor_marker_0
endBefore:end_sensor_marker_0
```

### Idempotence using run keys

In the above example, we are using the `run_key` parameter to enforce idempotence for each filename.
Dagster will ensure that only one run is created for each unique `run_key` value for a given sensor. In the example, even though the full directory contents are requested on every sensor evaluation, only new files will actually be requested due to the filename-based run key.

Run keys enable a sensor evaluation function to declaratively describe what runs should exist, rather than keeping track of cursors or timestamps.

If it is still useful to keep track of timestamps and cursors, some useful data are available on the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SensorExecutionContext"/>.

### Sensors in Dagit

You can view and operate sensors in Dagit. To view the sensors page, click the sensors tab in the left hand navigation pane.

Here, we can turn sensors on and off, and also see past executions of the sensor.

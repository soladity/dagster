# Schedules

Dagster includes a scheduler that can be used to submit runs on a fixed interval. To create a schedule, define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition"/> and include it in your repository.

Each schedule:

- Targets a pipeline
- Defines a function that returns `run_config` for the targeted pipeline
- Optionally defines `tags`, `mode`, and `solid_selection` for the target pipeline
- Optionally defines a `should_execute` function that can be used to skip a scheduled execution

## Defining a Schedule

Imagine we have a pipeline that computes metrics for a given date, and want to
compute those metrics on a fixed interval:

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_1
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_1
```

### Partition-based schedules

Partition-based schedules are useful when it's important for a successful run to exist for every
scheduled run time.
For example, if each run fills in a daily partition of a data warehouse table, basing your schedule
on a partition set allows you to track which days have corresponding runs and fill in gaps
when runs fail.

The <PyObject module="dagster" object="daily_schedule" displayText="@daily_schedule"/>, <PyObject module="dagster" object="hourly_schedule" displayText="@hourly_schedule"/>, <PyObject
  module="dagster"
  object="weekly_schedule"
  displayText="@weekly_schedule"
/>
, and <PyObject
  module="dagster"
  object="monthly_schedule"
  displayText="@monthly_schedule"
/> decorators each define a schedule that wraps an underlying <PyObject
  module="dagster"
  object="PartitionSetDefinition"
/>. Each partition in the set is a `datetime`.

The decorated schedule function should accept a `datetime` and return the run config for the
pipeline run associated with that partition. The scheduler will ensure that the schedule function
is evaluated exactly once for every partition to generate run config, which is then
used to create and launch a pipeline run.

Partition-based schedules require a `start_date` that indicates when the set of partitions begins.
The scheduler will only kick off runs for times that both come after the `start_date` and come
after the time when the schedule was turned on (usually in Dagit). If the
`start_date` is earlier than when the schedule is turned on, you can kick off runs for times
between the `start_date` and when the schedule is turned on by launching a
[backfill](/overview/partitions-backfill/backfill).

By default, the partition that is used for the run will be one partition earlier than the partition
that includes the current time, to capture a common ETL use case - for example, a daily schedule
will fill in the previous day's partition, and a monthly schedule will fill in last month's
partition. You can customize this behavior by changing the `partition_days_offset` parameter for a
daily schedule. The default value of this parameter is 1, which means that the scheduler goes back one day to determine
the partition. Setting the value to 0 will cause the
schedule to fill in the partition that corresponds to the current day, and increasing it above 1
will cause it to fill in an even earlier partition. A similarly-named parameter also exists for the other execution
intervals.

The following examples demonstrate schedules with an underlying partition set, each with a
different execution interval:

```python literalinclude caption=schedule_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/schedule_definition.py
lineno-start:
startAfter: start_part
endBefore: end_part
```

### Non-partition-based schedules

Non-partition-based schedules are useful when it's only important for a run to exist for the most
recent scheduled run time. For example, if each run drops and recreates a data warehouse table, then
there's usually no need to kick off runs corresponding to historical scheduled run times - those
runs would just have the same effect as a run for the most recent.

The <PyObject module="dagster" object="schedule" displayText="@schedule"/>
decorator defines a non-partitioned-based schedule with an arbitrary cron string. This decorator
should decorate a function that takes in a
`ScheduleExecutionContext` and returns run config for your run. The schedule will not create a
partition set, but you can access the execution time for your schedule by using the
`scheduled_execution_time` property on the passed-in `ScheduleExecutionContext` (assuming you're
using the recommended `DagsterDaemonScheduler` - the `scheduled_execution_time` property is not set
on the deprecated `SystemCronScheduler` or `K8sScheduler`).

At each time the schedule should execute the function will be
evaluated to generate the run config and a pipeline run will be launched with the run config.

```python literalinclude caption=schedule_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/schedule_definition.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_def
endBefore:end_def
```

## Running your schedule

Dagster's default scheduler, `DagsterDaemonScheduler`, runs as part
of the [dagster-daemon process](/overview/daemon). This scheduler uses checkpointing to ensure
that your schedule function runs exactly once per schedule interval, even if the scheduler goes
down. Check the [Deploying Dagster](/deploying) section of the docs for more on how to deploy
`dagster-daemon` to enable the use of this scheduler. Once `dagster-daemon` is deployed and your
schedule is turned on, your schedule should begin running at the interval specified by the schedule.

Dagster also supports configuring `SystemCronScheduler` and `K8sScheduler` on your Dagster instance,
but these schedulers are both deprecated - we recommend that you use `DagsterDaemonScheduler`.

## Timezones

Dagster supports executing your schedule in any IANA time zone. For example, the following schedule
executes daily at 9AM in US/Pacific time:

```python literalinclude caption=schedule_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/schedule_definition.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_timezone
endBefore:end_timezone
```

If you don't specify an execution timezone for your schedule, it will execute in your system
timezone. We recommend setting an execution timezone for all schedules, as unexpected behavior will
occur if different components in your deployment have different system timezones.

Only the default `DagsterDaemonScheduler` supports specifying an execution timezone that is
different from your system timezone.

### Daylight Savings Time

(This section assumes that you are using `DagsterDaemonScheduler` in your deployment)

Because of Daylight Savings Time transitions, it's possible to specify an execution time that does not
always exist (for example, 2019/03/10 at 2:30AM, since the clock jumps from 2:00AM to
3:00AM when the time zone changes). When this happens, Dagster will run your schedule at the next time that exists (in the previous example,
3:00AM).

It's also possible to specify a time that exists twice on one day every year (for example,
2019/11/03 at 1:30AM, since the hour from 1:00AM to 2:00AM repeats when the time zone changes) - in this case, dagster will execute
your schedule execute only once for that day, at the time associated with the new timezone.

Hourly schedules will be unaffected by daylight savings time transitions - the schedule will
continue to run exactly once every hour, even as the timezone changes.

## Schedules in Dagit

You can view and operate schedules in Dagit. To view the schedules page, click the schedules tab in the left hand navigation pane.

Here, we can turn schedules on and off, and also see runs previously created by the schedule.

# Run Coordinators

Run coordinators are a level above run launchers that manage where a run will be launched.

## DefaultRunCoordinator

The default run coordinator simply calls `launch_run` on the instance's run launcher. Hence clicking
`launch_run` in Dagit will cause the run to be launched by the Dagit process. Similarly, scheduled
runs will launch from whatever process the scheduler is running in.

## QueuedRunCoordinator

The QueuedRunCoordinator sends runs to the [Dagster Daemon](/overview/daemon) via a queue. The Daemon pulls from the
queue, and calls `launch_run` on the submitted runs. This enables instance-level
[limits on run concurrency](/overview/pipeline-runs/limiting-run-concurrency).

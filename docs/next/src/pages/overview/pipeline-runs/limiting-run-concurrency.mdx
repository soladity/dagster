# Limiting Run Concurrency

Dagster offers several options for limiting the number of concurrent pipeline runs on your instance. This can be useful when:

- Your cluster has limited capacity and you need to avoid flooding it
- You want to launch a backfill that only executes when there is capacity to spare, giving priority to other runs
- Some of your runs connect to an external service that shouldn’t be overloaded

## Setup

Concurrency limits are supported by the [QueuedRunCoordinator](/overview/pipeline-runs/run-coordinator), which uses the [Dagster Daemon](/overview/daemon) to coordinate which runs execute.
To use this run coordinator, configure it on your [Dagster instance](/overview/instances/dagster-instance) and include the daemon as part of your Dagster deployment.

## Usage

You can set the following parameters on the QueuedRunCoordinator by modifying its configuration in
the Dagster instance yaml.

### Run limits

You can place limits on the number of runs that can be in progress at a single time. Any runs beyond this limit will be queued, and won’t use any compute.

- An overall limit on the number of runs can be placed using the `max_concurrent_runs` key.
- More specific limits can be configured based on run tags, with `tag_concurrency_limits`. Limits can be specified for all runs with a certain tag key or key-value pair.

If any limit would be exceeded by launching a run, then the run will stay queued.

For example:

```yaml
# dagster.yaml
---
run_coordinator:
  module: dagster.core.run_coordinator
  class: QueuedRunCoordinator
  config:
    max_concurrent_runs: 25
    tag_concurrency_limits:
      - key: 'database'
        value: 'redshift'
        limit: 4
      - key: 'dagster/backfill'
        limit: 10
```

This run queue will only allow a maximum of 25 runs at once. Additionally, only 4 runs with the "database" tag equal to "redshift" can run at once, and at most 10 runs with the "dagster/backfill" tag and any value can run at once.

### Priorities

By default, runs are removed from the queue in the same order that they are submitted. By setting the tag
`dagster/priority` on a run (either in Dagit or on the pipeline definition in code), you can specify an integer value
as the run’s priority. By default, all runs have priority 0. Runs with greater priority values will be
launched first. Negative priorities are permitted, for example to deprioritize a backfill. If multiple
runs have equal priority, they execute in the order they were submitted.

### Queuing semantics

In the absence of tag limits and priorities, queued runs are first-in-first-out. However, a run that is blocked by tag limits will not block runs submitted after it.

To illustrate, let’s say we submit 3 runs in order: run A (tagged ‘foo’:‘bar’), run B (tagged ‘foo’:‘bar’), and run C (no tags). With no limits configured, the runs will be launched in the order they were submitted, A → B → C. Next, say we add the following instance configuration:

```yaml
tag_concurrency_limits:
  - key: 'foo'
    limit: 1
```

Now A and B are not able to execute concurrently, while there is no limit on C. Assume each will execute for at least a few minutes. If we submit in order A → B → C, then

- A launches
- B is passed over since A is in progress and there's a limit of 1 to concurrent ‘foo’ runs
- C launches
- Once A finishes, B launches

Thus the launch order will be A → C → B.

# Schedules

Dagster comes with a light weight scheduler that is capable of instigating runs on a given interval. To create a schedule, define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition"/> and include it in your repository.

A schedule has a number of properties:

- Targets a pipeline
- Defines a function that returns `run_config` for the targeted pipeline
- Optionally defines `tags`, `mode`, `solid_selection` for the target pipeline
- Optionally defines a `should_execute` function that can be used to skip a scheduled execution

## Defining a Schedule

There are two types of schedules:

- A simple cron-string based schedule creates runs at a given interval
- A partition set based schedule that also runs at a given interval, but selects a partition to use at execution time to create a run

### Example pipeline

For example, we have a pipeline that computes metrics data for a given date.

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
lineno-start:
lines:15-23
```

### Cron-string based interval

The simplest way to define a schedule is to use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="schedule" displayText="@schedule"/> decorator.
This decorator takes a cron schedule string and a pipeline name, and should decorate a function that returns run config to execute the pipeline with.

At every time the schedule should execute, according to the cron string, the function will be evaluated to generate the run config and a pipeline run will be created and run with the run config.

```python literalinclude caption=schedule_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/schedule_definition.py
lineno-start:
lines:4-10
```

### Partition set based schedule [recommended]

You can also create a schedule that is composed using an underyling partition set.
Each time the schedule executes, it selects the latest valid date partition and passes it to the decorated schedule function as an argument.

```python literalinclude caption=schedule_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/schedule_definition.py
lineno-start:
lines:13-39
```

### Schedules in Dagit

You can view and operate schedules in Dagit. To view the schedules page, click the schedules tab in the left hand navigation pane.

Here, we can turn schedules on and off, and also see past executions of the schedule.

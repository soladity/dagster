# Run Launcher

Runs instigated from the Dagit UI, the scheduler, or `dagster pipeline launch` are
"launched" in dagster. This is a distinct operation from "executing" a pipeline
using the `execute_pipeline` python API or the CLI `execute` command. Execution is
used mostly in testing and in Dagster internals. In production runs are launched.

The core abstraction in the launch process is the run launcher. It is configured
as part of the Dagster Instance.

The role of the run launcher is to be the interface to the computational
resources that will be used to actually execute dagster runs. It receives
the ID of a created run and a representation of the pipeline about to undergo
execution. It is responsible for allocating the computational resource for that
run (e.g. a process, a container, a kubernetes pod, etc) and then instigating
the computation within that resource.

The simplest version of the this is the built-in, default run launcher, <PyObject module="dagster.core.launcher" object="CliApiRunLauncher" />.
That run launcher spawns a new process on the current node for each run that is launched. It also
provides the ability to terminate that run, and it monitors launched processes to
detect unexpected process crashes.

Another example is  the <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher"/>,
which allocates a Kubernetes Job per run.

Anyone with any customizable infrastructure needs will almost need 
to write their own run launcher.

A few examples of when a custom run launcher is needed:

- You want to allocate different computational resources
for different pipelines or pipeline runs (e.g. GPUs for some, more cores or memory for other)
this decision and logic will be done in the run launcher.

- You have custom infrastructure or custom APIs for allocating nodes within your infrastructure.

Colloquially we refer to this launched process/computational resource as the run coordinator.
At this point, it is the *executor* -- an in-memory abstraction in the coordinator process -- that
takes over management of computational resources. The launcher only determines the behavior of
the run coordinator. The executors can range from single, in-process serial executors
all the way to managing per-step computational resources with a sophisticated control plane.

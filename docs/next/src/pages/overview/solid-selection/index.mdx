## Solid Selection Syntax

Dagit and the Dagster CLI support a simple query syntax for selecting a set of solid instances from
a pipeline.

It works as follows:
- A query includes a comma-separated list of _clauses_.  The result is the union of all the solids
  selected by each clause.
- A clause can be a solid name, in which case that solid is selected.
- A clause can be a solid name preceded by '*', in which case that solid and all of its ancestors
  (upstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be a solid name followed by '*', in which case that solid and all of its descendents
  (downstream dependencies) are selected.
- A clause can be a solid name followed by any number of '+'s, in which case that solid and
  descendents up to that many hops away are selected.
- A clause can be a solid name preceded by any number of '+'s, in which case that solid and
  ancestors up to that many hops away are selected.

### Clause examples

- `some_solid`: select "some_solid" itself
- `*some_solid`: select "some_solid" and all ancestors (upstream dependencies).
- `some_solid*`: select "some_solid" and all descendants (downstream dependencies).
- `*some_solid*`: select "some_solid" and all of its ancestors and descendants.
- `+some_solid`: select "some_solid" and its direct parents.
- `some_solid+++`: select "some_solid" and its children, its children's children, and its
  children's children's children.

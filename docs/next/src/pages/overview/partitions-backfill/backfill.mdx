# Backfills using Partitions

After defining a [partition set](/overview/partitions-backfill/partitions), you can use backfills to instigate pipeline runs for each partition
in the set.

## Backfills in Dagit

You can launch and monitor backfills from [the Partitions tab](/overview/partitions-backfill/partitions#the-partitions-tab) of a Pipeline page in Dagit.

### Launching a Backfill

To launch a backfill, click the "Launch backfill" button at the top center of the [Partitions tab](/overview/partitions-backfill/partitions#the-partitions-tab).

This opens the "Launch backfill" modal, which lets you select the set of partitions to launch the backfill over.

<!-- This was generated with:
    * `dagit -f repo.py` inside docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/ directory
    * Navigating to the partitions page for `my_data_pipeline`
-->

You can click the button on the bottom right to submit the runs.  What happens when you hit this button depends on your [run coordinator](http://localhost:3001/overview/pipeline-runs/run-coordinator).  With the default run coordinator, the modal will exit after all runs have been launched.  With the queued run coordinator, the modal will exit after all runs have been queued.

After all the runs have been submitted, you'll be returned to the partitions page, with a filter for runs inside the backfill. This refreshes periodically and allows you to see how the backfill is progressing. Boxes become green or red as steps in the backfill runs succeed or fail.

## Using the Backfill CLI

In the [Partitions](/overview/partitions-backfill/partitions) section, we defined a pipeline and
a `date_partition_set` partition set that targeted the pipeline:

```python literalinclude caption=partition_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/partition_definition.py
lineno-start:
startAfter: start_def
endBefore: end_def
```

Let's also setup a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RepositoryDefinition"/> and `workspace.yaml` for this pipeline and partition set:

```python literalinclude caption=repo.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/repo.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_repo_marker_0
endBefore:end_repo_marker_0
```

```python literalinclude caption=workspace.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/file_workspace.yaml
```

### Executing the backfill

Now we can run the command `dagster pipeline backfill` to execute the backfill. To run all partitions,
simply run the command with the arguments to specify the pipeline and partition set.

```
$ dagster pipeline backfill -p my_data_pipeline --partition-set date_partition_set


     Pipeline: my_data_pipeline
Partition set: date_partition_set
   Partitions:
               2020-05-01          2020-05-02          2020-05-03          2020-05-04          2020-05-05          2020-05-06          2020-05-07
               2020-05-08          2020-05-09          2020-05-10          2020-05-11          2020-05-12          2020-05-13          2020-05-14
               2020-05-15          2020-05-16          2020-05-17          2020-05-18          2020-05-19          2020-05-20          2020-05-21
               2020-05-22          2020-05-23          2020-05-24          2020-05-25          2020-05-26          2020-05-27          2020-05-28
               2020-05-29          2020-05-30          2020-05-31

Do you want to proceed with the backfill (31 partitions)? [y/N]:

### Executing a subset of partitions

You can also execute subsets of the partition sets.

#### Manually specifying partitions

You can specify the `--partitions` argument and provide a comma-separated list of partition names you want to backfill

```bash
$ dagster pipeline backfill -p my_pipeline --partition-set date_partition_set --partitions M,Tu,W
```

You can also specify ranges of partitions using the `--from` and `--to` arguments:

```bash
$ dagster pipeline backfill -p my_pipeline --partition-set date_partition_set --from W --to F
```

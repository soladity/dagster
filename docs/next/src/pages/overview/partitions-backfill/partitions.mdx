# Partition Sets

Dagster provides the _partition set_ abstraction for pipelines where each run deals with
a subset of data.

Users define a set of logical "partitions", usually time windows, along with a scheme for building
pipeline config from a partition name. With this, they can kick off a pipeline run or set of
pipeline runs by simply selecting a partition or set of partitions.

Partitions have two main uses:

- Scheduling - e.g. a pipeline runs each day and processes the data that arrived during the
  previous day as a single partition.
- Backfills - all at once, kick off a pipeline run per partition, e.g. to reprocess the data that
  arrived for each day in the history.

## Defining a Partition Set

To define a partition set, we use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="PartitionSetDefinition"/> class.

A partition set targets a pipeline, and must define two functions:

- `partition_fn`: Returns a list of <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition"/>.
- `run_config_fn_for_partition`: Given a <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition"/>, returns the run
  configuration that parameterizes the execution for this partition, as a dict.

### Example

For example, here's a pipeline that computes some data for a given date.

```python literalinclude caption=pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/pipeline.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_1
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_1
```

The solid `process_data_for_date` takes, as config, a string `date`. This piece of config will
define which date to compute data for. For example, if we wanted to compute for May 5th, 2020,
we would execute the pipeline with the following config:

```python literalinclude caption=config.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/config.yaml
```

We can define a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PartitionSetDefinition"/> that defines the full set of
partitions and how to define the run config for a given partition.

```python literalinclude caption=partition_definition.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/partition_definition.py
lineno-start:
startAfter:start_def
endBefore:end_def
```

## Partitions in Dagit

### The Partitions Tab
You can view runs by partition in the Partitions tab of a Pipeline page.

In the "Run Matrix", each column corresponds to one of the partitions in the partition set.  Each row corresponds to one
of the steps in the pipeline.

<!-- This was generated with:
    * `dagit -f repo.py` inside docs_snippets/overview/schedules_partitions/ directory
    * Navigating to the partitions page for `my_data_pipeline`

You can click on individual boxes to see the history of runs for that step and partition.

### Launching Partitioned Runs from the Playground

You can view and use partitions in the Dagit playground view for a pipeline. In the top bar, you can
select from the list of all available partition sets, then choose a specific partition.
Within the config editor, the config for the selected partition will be populated.

In the screenshot below, we select the `date_partition_set` and the `2020-05-01` partition, and we can see that
the correct run config for the partition has been populated in the editor.

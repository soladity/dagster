# API Docs

These docs aim to cover the entire public surface of the core `dagster` APIs, as well as public APIs
from all provided libraries.

Dagster follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/), and is currently pre-1.0. We attempt to isolate
breaking changes to the public APIs to minor versions (on a roughly 12-week cadence) and will
announce deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions (on a roughly weekly
cadence).

## Core

APIs from the core `dagster` package, divided roughly by topic:

- [Solids](/_apidocs/solids)
  APIs to define or decorate functions as solids, declare their inputs
  and outputs, compose solids with each other, as well as the
  datatypes that solid execution can return or yield.

- [Pipelines](/_apidocs/pipeline)
  APIs to define pipelines, dependencies and fan-in dependencies
  between solids, and aliased instances of solids.

- [Modes & Resources](/_apidocs/modes-resources)
  APIs to define pipeline modes and resources.

- [Presets](/_apidocs/presets)
  APIs to define configuration presets.

- [Loggers](/_apidocs/loggers)
  APIs to define where logs go.

- [Repositories](/_apidocs/repositories)
  APIs to define collections of pipelines and other definitions that tools
  such as the Dagster CLI or Dagit can load from.

- [Config](/_apidocs/config)
  The types available to describe config schemas.

- [Types](/_apidocs/types)
  Primitive types available for the input and output values of solids,
  and the APIs used to define and test new Dagster types.

- [Dagster CLI](/_apidocs/cli)
  Browse repositories and execute pipelines from the command line

- [Schedules](/_apidocs/schedules)
  APIs to define schedules on which pipelines are run, as well as a
  few built-in defaults.

- [Partitions](/_apidocs/partitions)
  APIs to define partitions of the config space over which pipeline
  runs can be backfilled.

- [Errors](/_apidocs/errors)
  Errors thrown by the Dagster framework.

- [Execution](/_apidocs/execution)
  APIs to execute and test pipelines and individual solids, the
  execution context available to solids, pipeline configuration, the
  default system storages used for intermediates, and the default
  executors available for executing pipelines.

- [Utilities](/_apidocs/utilities)
  Miscellaneous helpers used by Dagster that may be useful to users.

- [Internals](/_apidocs/internals)
  Core internal APIs that are important if you are interested in
  understanding how Dagster works with an eye towards extending it:
  logging, executors, system storage, the Dagster instance & plugin
  machinery, storage, schedulers.

## Libraries

Dagster includes a number of non-core libraries that provide integrations and additional
functionality:

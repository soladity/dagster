# Advanced: Scheduling Pipeline Runs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/" />

Dagster includes a scheduler that allows you to run pipelines at regular intervals, e.g. daily or
hourly.

## Defining schedules

As before, we've defined a solid and a pipeline.

```python literalinclude showLines caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_0
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_0
```

Suppose that we need to run our simple cereal pipeline every morning before breakfast, at
6:45 AM. To do this, we'll write a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to define our schedule.
We can either directly construct a `ScheduleDefinition`, or use one of the included schedule
decorators.

In this example, we'll use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="daily_schedule" displayText="@daily_schedule" />
decorator, which runs a schedule once a day at a specified time.

The decorated function should return the `run_config` needed to run the schedule at the
specified execution time. The function is passed the datetime for which the schedule is running.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=31 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_1
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_1
```

To complete the picture, we'll need to add the schedule definition to the list of definitions returned
from our repository.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=49 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_2
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_2
```

## Starting schedules

Now, we can load Dagit to view the schedule, start and stop it, and monitor the runs it creates:

```bash
dagit -f scheduler.py
```

Our Dagit now displays a Schedules section on the left sidebar.

Clicking on `good_morning_schedule` will take us to the Schedules view. From here, we can
turn on the schedule by pressing the toggle button, at which point dagit will show us that the
schedule is running and will next execute tomorrow at 6:45 AM.

### Running the schedule

Dagster's default scheduler requires you to launch a long-running `dagster-daemon` process in
addition to Dagit.

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

This process will periodically check for any running schedules and launch their associated runs. If
you leave this process running, it will launch a new run for your schedule each day at the expected
time.

### Schedule filters

If you need to customize the times at which the schedule shoule execute, you can pass a function as
the `should_execute` argument to <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />.

For example, we can define a filter that only returns _`True`_ on weekdays:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=57 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_3
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_3
```

If we combine this `should_execute` filter with a
schedule that runs at 6:45am every day, then we'll
have a schedule that runs at 6:45am only on weekdays.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=66 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_4
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_4
```

# Advanced: Intermediates

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/" />

We've already seen how solids can describe their persistent artifacts to the
system using [materializations](/tutorial/advanced_materializations).

Dagster also has a facility for automatically materializing the intermediate
values that actually pass between solids.

This can be very useful for debugging, when you want to inspect the value
output by a solid and ensure that it is as you expect; for audit, when you
want to understand how a particular downstream output was created; and for
re-executing downstream solids with cached results from expensive upstream
computations.

To turn intermediate storage on, just set another key in the pipeline config:

```YAML literalinclude caption=intermediates.yaml emphasize-lines=6-7
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/intermediates.yaml
```

When you execute the pipeline using this config, you'll see new structured
entries in the Dagit log viewer indicating that intermediates have been stored
on the filesystem.

## Re-execution

Once intermediates are being stored, you can individually re-execute
steps whose outputs are satisfied by previously stored intermediates through
Dagit or the Python API.

### Re-execute a pipeline in Dagit

Click on the `sort_by_calories.compute` execution step, and you'll see the
option appear to re-execute the selected step subset, using the automatically
materialized intermediate output of the previous solid.

![reexecution.png](/assets/images/tutorial/reexecution.png)

Re-executing the selected subset, `sort_by_calories.compute` in this case, will
skip the `read_csv.compute` step and use the previously stored intermediate
instead. You may also notice there is a re-execution section present on the
right hand side. This section allows you to view and switch between related
pipeline runs created from re-execution.

![reexecution_results.png](/assets/images/tutorial/reexecution_results.png)

Re-executing step subsets can be very helpful while you're writing solids, or
while you're actively debugging only part of a pipeline.

You can also manually specify intermediates from previous runs as inputs to
solids. Recall the syntax we used to set input values using the config system:

```YAML literalinclude caption=inputs_env.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs_env.yaml
```

Instead of setting the `value` key (i.e., providing a CSV file), we can
also set `pickle`, as follows:

```YAML literalinclude caption=reexecution_env.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/reexecution_env.yaml
```

(Of course, you'll need to use the path to an intermediate that is actually
present on your filesystem.)

If you directly substitute this config into Dagit, you'll see an error,
because the system still expects the input to `sort_by_calories` to
be satisfied by the output from `read_csv`.

![reexecution_errors.png](/assets/images/tutorial/reexecution_errors.png)

To make this config valid, we'll need to tell Dagit to execute only a subset
of the pipeline --just the `sort_by_calories` solid. Click on the
subset-selector button in the top left of the playground, to the left of the
Mode selector (which, when no subset has been specified, will read "\*"):

![subset_selection.png](/assets/images/tutorial/subset_selection.png)

Now this config will pass validation, and the individual solid can be
re-executed.

This facility is especially valuable during testing, since it allows you to
validate newly written solids against values generated during previous runs of
a known good pipeline.

### Re-execute a pipeline through Python API

Similar to the <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline"
displayText="execute_pipeline()" /> function, we've also introduced a Python API
for re-executing pipelines from code: <PyObject module="dagster" object="reexecute_pipeline"
displayText="reexecute_pipeline()" />, where you will need to pass the run ID of
the run being re-executed as the `parent_run_id` argument, and optionally use
`step_keys_to_execute` to specify a list of step keys that you would like to
re-execute.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=40 caption=reexecution.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/reexecution.py
startAfter:start_reexecution_marker_0
endBefore:end_reexecution_marker_0
```

When you specify `step_keys_to_execute` as above, you will find that in the logs,
the `read_csv.compute` step says "Copying intermediate object for input result from" the
previously stored `storage_location/intermediates/read_csv.compute/result`. This
indicates that you have skipped this step and are using the previously computed result
instead during this re-execution.

```bash
2020-06-15 22:29:55 - dagster - DEBUG - reexecution_pipeline - 75561568-1f1f-49ab-ab70-30460cc257ad - OBJECT_STORE_OPERATION - Copied intermediate object for input result from /var/folders/fz/klcrnttj13v_8cv3m6_4hlsh0000gn/T/tmpyx2oin8v/storage/9b6d2373-5570-4525-a8b5-257860ec2a6f/intermediates/read_csv.compute/result to /var/folders/fz/klcrnttj13v_8cv3m6_4hlsh0000gn/T/tmpyx2oin8v/storage/75561568-1f1f-49ab-ab70-30460cc257ad/intermediates/read_csv.compute/result
 event_specific_data = {"metadata_entries": [["key", null, ["/var/folders/fz/klcrnttj13v_8cv3m6_4hlsh0000gn/T/tmpyx2oin8v/storage/9b6d2373-5570-4525-a8b5-257860ec2a6f/intermediates/read_csv.compute/result"]]], "op": "CP_OBJECT", "value_name": "result"}
               solid = "read_csv"
    solid_definition = "read_csv"
            step_key = "read_csv"
```

## Intermediate Storage for Custom Data Types

By default, Dagster will try to pickle intermediate values to store them on
the filesystem. Some custom data types cannot be pickled (for instance, a
Spark RDD), so you will need to tell Dagster how to serialize them.

Our toy `LessSimpleDataFrame` is, of course, pickleable, but
supposing it was not, let's set a custom **`SerializationStrategy`** on
it to tell Dagster how to store intermediates of this type.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=16 caption=serialization_strategy.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/serialization_strategy.py
startAfter:start_serialization_strategy_marker_0
endBefore:end_serialization_strategy_marker_0
```

Now, when we set the `storage` key in the pipeline config and run this
pipeline, we'll see that our intermediate is automatically persisted as a
human-readable .csv:

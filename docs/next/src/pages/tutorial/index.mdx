# Tutorial

If you're new to Dagster, we recommend working through this tutorial to become
familiar with Dagster's feature set and tooling, using small examples that are
intended to be illustrative of real data problems.

## Tutorials

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- [**Setup for the Tutorial**](/tutorial/setup) will give you a starting point to follow the
  tutorial.
- [**Overview**](/tutorial/overview) will teach you the fundamental concepts of Dagster: solids
  and pipelines.
- [**Building Pipelines with Dagster**](/tutorial/execute) will teach you ways to construct and execute a
  simple data pipeline.
- [**Basics of Solids**](/tutorial/basics_solids) will teach you the basics of using solids.
- [**Basics of Pipelines**](/tutorial/basics_pipelines) will teach you the basics of using
  pipelines.
- [**Making Your Pipelines Testable and Maintainable**](/tutorial/testable) will show you how
  to test your pipelines.
- [**Dagster Types & Expectations**](/tutorial/types) covers Dagster's type system and
  defining expectations.

## Advanced Tutorials

These sections will introduce some advanced features and give you deeper insight into Dagster.

- [**Advanced: Solids**](/tutorial/advanced_solids) demonstrates more ways you can
  use solids, e.g. by creating reusable solids.
- [**Advanced: Pipelines**](/tutorial/advanced_pipelines) demonstrates configuring
  pipeline-wide facilities to avoiding repeated code or config with unchanged business logic.
- [**Advanced: Materializations**](/tutorial/advanced_materializations) demonstrates a way to
  make Dagster aware of your persistent artifacts outside the system.
- [**Advanced: Intermediates**](/tutorial/advanced_intermediates) demonstrates how to persist the use of
  serialized "intermediate" values passed between solids.
- [**Advanced: Organizing Pipelines in Repositories & Workspaces**](/tutorial/advanced_repositories)
  demonstrates constructs that are useful when you have many pipelines that you need to organize.
- [**Advanced: Scheduling Pipeline Runs**](/tutorial/advanced_scheduling) will show you how to
  schedule pipelines to run at regular intervals using cron.

## What Are We Building?

We'll build examples around a simple but scary CSV dataset, `cereal.csv`, which contains nutritional
facts about 80 breakfast cereals. You can find this dataset on <VersionedGithubLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv" word="Github" />.
Or, if you've cloned the dagster git repository, you'll find this dataset at
`dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv`

To get the flavor of this dataset, let's look at the header and the first five
rows:

```CSV literalinclude caption=cereal.csv
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv
lines:1-6
```

You can find all of the <VersionedGithubLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial" word="tutorial code" />
checked into the dagster repository.

Abstracting business logic into reusable, configurable solids is one important step towards making
data applications like other software applications.

## Reusable Solids

Solids are intended to abstract chunks of business logic, but abstractions aren't very meaningful
unless they can be reused.

Our conditional outputs pipeline included a lot of repeated
code&mdash;`sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and `sort_cold_cereals_by_calories`, for instance. In
general, it's preferable to build pipelines out of a relatively restricted set of well-tested
library solids, using config liberally to parametrize them. You'll certainly have your own version
of `read_csv`, for instance, and Dagster includes libraries like
[`dagster_aws`](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster_aws) and
[`dagster_spark`](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster_pyspark) to wrap and abstract interfaces with
common third party tools.

Let's replace `sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and `sort_cold_cereals_by_calories` by two aliases of
the same library solid:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=56 emphasize-lines=17-18 caption=reusable_solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.py
lines:56-75
```

You'll see that Dagit distinguishes between the two invocations of the single library solid and the
solid's definition. The invocation is named and bound via a dependency graph to other invocations of
other solids. The definition is the generic, reusable piece of logic that is invoked many times
within this pipeline.

Configuring solids also uses the aliases, as in the following YAML:

```YAML literalinclude emphasize-lines=6,8 caption=reusable_solids.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.yaml
```

## Composite Solids

The other basic facility that we expect from software in other domains is composability&mdash;the
ability to combine building blocks into larger functional units.

Composite solids can be used to organize and refactor large or complicated pipelines, abstracting
away complexity, as well as to wrap reusable general-purpose solids together with domain-specific
logic.

As an example, let's compose two instances of a complex, general-purpose `read_csv` solid along with
some domain-specific logic for the specific purpose of joining our cereal dataset with a lookup
table providing human-readable names for the cereal manufacturers.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=128 caption=composite_solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/composite_solids.py
lines:128-132
```

Defining a composite solid is similar to defining a pipeline, except
that we use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="composite_solid" displayText="@composite_solid" /> decorator
instead of <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" />. Dagit has
sophisticated facilities for visualizing composite solids:

![composite_solids.png](/assets/images/tutorial/composite_solids.png)

All of the complexity of the composite solid is hidden by default, but we can expand it at will by
clicking into the solid (or on the "Expand" button in the right-hand pane):

![composite_solids_expanded.png](/assets/images/tutorial/composite_solids_expanded.png)

Note the line indicating that the output of `join_cereal` is returned as the output of the composite
solid as a whole.

Config for the individual solids making up the composite is nested, as follows:

```YAML literalinclude emphasize-lines=1-3 caption=composite_solids.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/composite_solids.yaml
```

When we execute this pipeline, Dagit includes information about the nesting of individual execution
steps within the composite:

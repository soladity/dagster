# Overview

Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of Dagster!

In the `hello_pipeline` example, you may find that there are some new concepts that you are not
familiar with, such as solids and pipelines. The **pipeline** can be visualized as above, in which
the **solid** `get_name` returns a name of `'dagster'` and passes that **output** to the solid
`hello`.

With these basic Dagster concepts, we'll give more concrete definitions of these terms:

- **[Solid](/overview/solids-pipelines/solids):** a solid is a functional unit of computation with defined
  inputs and outputs.

- **[Pipeline](/overview/solids-pipelines/pipelines):** in Dagster, pipelines are directed acyclic
  graphs (DAGs) of solids – that is, they are made up of a
  number of solids which have data dependencies on each other (but no circular dependencies).

- **[Output](/overview/solids-pipelines/solids#solid-inputs-and-outputs):** an output is how a solid’s compute function
  communicates the name and value of an output to Dagster.

- **[Dependencies](/overview/solids-pipelines/pipelines):** solids are linked together into pipelines
  by defining the dependencies between their inputs and outputs. An important difference between
  Dagster and other workflow systems is that in Dagster, dependencies are expressed as data
  dependencies ("A requires a particular output from B"), not only ordering dependencies ("A runs
  after B").

You can learn more about Dagster concepts by reading [Overviews](/overview) section.

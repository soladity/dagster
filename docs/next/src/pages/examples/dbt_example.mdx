# dbt Examples

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/dbt_example" />

Here provides examples of how to use [`dagster-dbt`](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster_dbt) to integrate
your existing [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project with the Dagster platform.

This example illustrates how custom solids can be combined with dbt commands in a Dagster
pipeline. It will be using the [dbt_example_project](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dbt_example/dbt_example_project)
provided by [fishtown-analytics/dbt-starter-project](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-starter-project).

## Getting Started

Before you start, let's make sure you have the environment ready.

1. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Running inside a Python virtualenv
   is recommended.

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. The example dbt project requires a running Postgres database. By default, the project will
   attempt to connect to `postgresql://dbt_example:dbt_example@localhost:5432/dbt_example`.
   If you are running Docker, have Docker Compose installed, and aren't running any other process
   bound to port 5432, you can bring up a default database with this address by running:

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   If you'd like to run the project against a different running database, please set the the
   following environment variables as appropriate:

   - `DAGSTER_DBT_EXAMPLE_PGHOST`
   - `DAGSTER_DBT_EXAMPLE_PGPORT`
   - `DAGSTER_DBT_EXAMPLE_PGUSER`
   - `DAGSTER_DBT_EXAMPLE_PGPASSWORD`

3. Add the profile for the [`dbt_example_project`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dbt_example/dbt_example_project)
   directory to your dbt 'profiles.yml' file.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.dbt/
   touch ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
   cat dbt_example_project/profiles.yml >> ~/.dbt/profiles.yml
   ```

   Test that this is correctly setup by running `dbt ls`:

   ```
   dbt ls --project-dir dbt_example_project
   ```

4. You are all set.

## Execute dbt pipeline using Dagster

```python literalinclude caption=pipelines.py
file:/dbt_example/dbt_example/pipelines.py
startAfter:start_pipeline_marker_0
endBefore:end_pipeline_marker_0
```

Run [Dagit](/overview/dagit) locally by running the command:

```
$ dagit -m dbt_example
```

You will see that Dagit has rendered the pipeline defined by the code above.

The pipeline definition has also provided pre-defined configurations through <PyObject module="dagster" object="PresetDefinition" />
and convenient ways to switch configurations between different modes via <PyObject module="dagster" object="ModeDefinition" />.

After switching to Dagit's Playground, you can load one of pre-defined Preset to execute the pipeline.

After Launch Execution, you will then see the pipeline being executed and logs as below:

## Execute dbt commands in Dagster solids

Let's look into one of the solids and see how Dagster works with dbt commands.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/dbt_example/dbt_example/solids.py
startAfter:start_solid_marker_0
endBefore:end_solid_marker_0
```

For example, the solid `run_cereals_models` is created by <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_cli_run" displayText="dagster_dbt.dbt_cli_run"/>
with the [`configured`](/overview/configuration/configured) Dagster API.

The solid executes `dbt run` via the dbt CLI. As you may have noticed in the log above, the solid 
also logs the output from the dbt CLI execution in a few <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> 
events, which allow you to track the external entities in the ["Asset Catalog"](/overview/asset-materializations).

You can find more functionalities with detailed API reference in [`dagster-dbt`](/_apidocs/libraries/dagster_dbt) library.

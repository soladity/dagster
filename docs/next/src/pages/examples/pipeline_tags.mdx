# Solid and Pipeline Tags

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/pipeline_tags" />

A Dagster pipeline can be annotated with `tags`, which contains arbitrary metadata for any
execution run of the pipeline. Tag values that are not strings will be json encoded and must meet
the criteria that `json.loads(json.dumps(value)) == value`. In this example, we have a pipeline
`my_pipeline` that contains `tags={'owner': 'ml_team'}`.

Previous Pipeline Runs are searchable by `tags`, which are stored on the Pipeline Run in the
Run Storage. To search previous Pipeline Runs in Dagit, navigate to the Runs tab and enter the
filter `tag:owner=ml_team`.

Tag values can be overwritten at pipeline invocation time. To try this in Dagit, navigate to
Playground tab and click `Edit Tags` to modify tags for that run.

As an aside, during the execution of the pipeline, `tags` can be accessed from the `context`
of the solid (as seen in `get_tag`) although it is not recommended to use tags to drive logic.

Note that solids can be tagged as well. Similar to the use-case for pipelines, tags allow for
optional, JSON-encodable metadata to be attached to the solid. Some dagster packages may expect
or require certain metadata to be attached to a solid.

In this example, we have a solid `get_tag` that contains `tags={"metadata": "some_metadata"}`.
Tags for solids can also be accessed during the execution of a pipeline (see `get_tag`).

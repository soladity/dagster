# Fan-in Pipeline

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/fan_in_pipeline" />

This pipeline demonstrates how to create a "fan-in" dependency, which is when a `solid` waits for
a set of other `solid`s to complete before continuing processing. In this example, `sum_fan_in`
collects a list of `SolidOutputHandle`s, one for each `return_one` `solid`, which are passed as a
`List[int]` input to `sum_fan_in`.

In the case where the preceding `solid`s are not of the same type, the `SolidOutputHandle`s can be
passed into the "fan-in" solid individually (instead of in a `List`).

An example with configurable levels of fan-ins and fan-outs can be found

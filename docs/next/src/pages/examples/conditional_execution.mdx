# Conditional Execution

This example demonstrates how to conditionally execute part of a pipeline based on what happens inside a solid.

In this example, we choose a branch of the pipeline to execute at random. In `branching_solid`, we randomly generate a number. If it's zero, we execute `branch_1_solid`. Otherwise, we execute `branch_2_solid`.

Dagster's mechanism for conditional execution is non-required outputs. For any solid output definition, we can set the `is_required` argument to `False`. If any of the inputs to a solid come from non-required outputs, and any of those non-required outputs are not yielded by the upstream solid, then the solid won't run.

In this example, `branching_solid` only yields an `Output` for `branch_1` if it picks zero. If one is chosen, no output for `branch_1` will be yielded, so `branch_1_solid` will be missing an input, and it won't run.

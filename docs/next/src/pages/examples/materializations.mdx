# Assets and Materializations

Dagster solids often produce persistent assets which represent a result of some computation. In
Dagster pipelines, these assets are often by-products or side-effects of a solid's computation,
distinct from the `Output` returned by a solid. Dagster solids can describe these assets by
yielding a `Materialization` event and attaching useful metadata.

Materialization events optionally include an `AssetKey`, which serves as an organizational index
across pipelines and runs. These materialized assets are represented in `dagit` under the `Assets`
tab and cross-reference the pipelines and runs that generate them. This is useful not only for
quickly viewing the status of an asset, but also for better understanding the relationship over time
between the asset and the computation that created it.

This example sets up a pipeline that materializes an asset annotated with metadata, and builds that
asset view in `dagit`.

Disclaimer: The `Assets` tab on dagit is only enabled for instances configured with an "asset-aware"
event log storage, such as `PostgresEventLogStorage` and `ConsolidatedSqliteEventLogStorage`. Please
refer to our [deployment documentation](https://docs.dagster.io/deploying/instance) for more
information about configuring your Dagster instance.

# Deploying Dagster on Kubernetes

**NOTE**: The Dagster Kubernetes deployment and Helm chart is still in the early stages of
development and is actively being improved. You can expect this process to change substantially over
time.

To get a Dagster deployment running on Kubernetes, you'll need 2 Docker images. One for Celery
workers, which will not need user code and will not need to be updated on pipeline code changes, and
one for your pipelines, which is used for Dagit and pipeline execution, and must be redeployed on
pipeline code changes.

## Celery Image

The celery image should look like:

```Dockerfile literalinclude caption=Dockerfile
file:/deploy_k8s/Dockerfile
```

Build and push this to whatever registry you're using:

```
export DOCKER_IMAGE="$YOUR_REGISTRY_URI/dagster-k8s-demo:dagster-celery-example"
docker build . -t $DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE
```

## User Code Image

First, you'll need a Dagster repository with the following structure:

```tree
example_project
├── Dockerfile
├── example_repo
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── repo.py
├── run_config
│   └── example-k8s.yaml
└── workspace.yaml
```

The `workspace.yaml` file should contain:

```yaml literalinclude caption=workspace.yaml
file:/deploy_k8s/example_project/workspace.yaml
```

**NOTE:** Make sure you don't forget to include `location_name` here, as you'll need to reference
that later in your pipeline run config to execute the pipeline.

A minimal repo/pipeline that this points to might look like:

```python literalinclude caption=repo.py
file:/deploy_k8s/example_project/example_repo/repo.py
```

And you'll need a second Dockerfile which, per the directory structure above, `ADD`s your pipelines
and `workspace.yaml`:

```Dockerfile literalinclude caption=Dockerfile
file:/deploy_k8s/example_project/Dockerfile
```

Now, build and push this second Docker image to your registry:

```
export DOCKER_IMAGE="$YOUR_REGISTRY_URI/dagster-k8s-demo:dagster-pipe-example"
docker build . -t $DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE
```

Now, you can use the Dagster Helm chart to install Dagster on your Kubernetes cluster. First, you'll
need to create a `values.yaml` to configure the images:

```yaml literalinclude caption=values.yaml
file:/deploy_k8s/values.yaml
```

Then, you can clone the Dagster repo and install the Helm chart (we do not yet host our Helm chart,
but will soon!):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster.git
cd dagster/python_modules/libraries/dagster_k8s/
helm install dagster helm/dagster -f /path/to/your/values.yaml
```

Helm will launch several pods including PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ; you can check the status of the
installation with `kubectl`. If everything worked correctly, you should see output like the
following:

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
dagster-celery-workers-76f9df6b76-8zgz7                  1/1     Running     0          25s
dagster-celery-workers-76f9df6b76-995wx                  1/1     Running     0          25s
dagster-celery-workers-76f9df6b76-c7g7c                  1/1     Running     0          25s

dagster-flower-b84bcd6dc-ttqkr                           1/1     Running     0          25s
dagster-postgresql-0                                     1/1     Running     0          14s
dagster-rabbitmq-0                                       1/1     Running     0          25s
```

It will also print instructions to open port forwarding to the Dagit pod; you can run these commands
locally to load up the Dagit UI:

```
export DAGIT_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=dagster,app.kubernetes.io/instance=dagster,component=dagit" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to open Dagit"
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $DAGIT_POD_NAME 8080:80
```

Finally, you can visit the playground in Dagit to kick off execution. If you used the port fowarding
above, this should be at http://127.0.0.1:8080/pipeline/example_pipe/playground.

To execute the pipeline, you'll need to include the following run configuration in the playground
editor. First, the solid configuration:

```yaml literalinclude caption=run_config_1.yaml
file:/deploy_k8s/example_project/run_config/pipeline.yaml
```

Second, the configuration for `celery-k8s` and for intermediates storage:

```yaml literalinclude caption=run_config_2.yaml
file:/deploy_k8s/example_project/run_config/celery_k8s.yaml
```

Note that here we've referenced the repository location that we previously listed in our
`workspace.yaml`.

Finally, click "Launch Execution" and you should see the pipeline execute on Kubernetes! You can
introspect the jobs that were launched with `kubectl`:

```
kubectl get jobs
NAME                                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE

dagster-job-bbc47774c005362518d30e575074ab11       1/1           9s         25s
dagster-run-2fd98c73-0c15-492a-9128-4b98f3b14a80   1/1           29s        41s
```

# Great Expectations integration

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/ge_example" />

This example demonstrates how to use the GE solid factory
to test incoming data against a set of expectations built through
[Great Expectations'](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/) tooling.

For this example, we'll be using two versions of a dataset of baseball team payroll and wins,
with one version modified to hold incorrect data.

The basic call to the GE solid factory is below, with two arguments: datasource name and expectation suite name.

The optional third argument, validation operator, isn't used here -- since we're just having the default behavior of
'validate the solid, output the results'.

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:27-29
```

And here's how you could use that call with other solids.

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:19-24
```

(alternatively, one could use hooks
to respond to the expectation result see [here](https://docs.dagster.io/examples/hooks))

Lets take a brief look at some of the config here.

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_example/ge_demo.py
lines:35-74
```

We've got two presets which are pretty similar (the only difference is whether
they've got a good or bad file passed into the initial solid), the relevant
new piece of config is lines 39-43, where the GE data_context is configured.
All we need to do to expose GE to Dagster is to provide the root of the GE directory (the path to the
great_expectations file on your machine).

Finally, here's the full pipeline using the GE solid, with presets to use both the
correct and incorrect data:

```python literalinclude caption=ge_demo.py
file:/ge_example/ge_example/ge_demo.py
startAfter: start_ge_demo_marker_0
endBefore: end_ge_demo_marker_0
```

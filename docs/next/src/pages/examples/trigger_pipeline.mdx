# Execute Pipeline by GraphQL

<ExampleReferenceLink filePath="examples/trigger_pipeline" />

This demonstrates how to trigger a Dagster pipeline externally by a GraphQL client.

## Create a GraphQL client

First of all, run `pip install --pre gql[requests]` to install GQL 3 (the GraphQL Client for Python 3.6+)
with the `requests` dependency. After installation, you can start using GQL by importing from the top-level `gql` package.
For more information about GQL 3 installation, read the GQL 3 [documentation](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/v3.0.0a5/intro.html).

This example uses the `RequestsHTTPTransport` to communicate with the backend.
By default, the destination url is `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.
You can create a GraphQL client with the selected transport and the url endpoint like below:

```python literalinclude caption=trigger.py
file:/trigger_pipeline/trigger_pipeline/trigger.py
startAfter:start_trigger_marker_0
endBefore:end_trigger_marker_0
```

## Trigger a pipeline over GraphQL

To query GraphQL, you can use the `launchPipelineExecution` mutation.

```python literalinclude caption=trigger.py
file:/trigger_pipeline/trigger_pipeline/trigger.py
startAfter:start_trigger_marker_1
endBefore:end_trigger_marker_1
```

Next, you provide the file or the module where your repository lives for the `repositoryLocationName`.
Here, the `repositoryLocationName` is `repo.py`. You also pass the name of your repository to `repositoryName`.
In this example, it is called `my_repo`. If you have never run a collectioin of pipelines using the concept of a repository before,
check our documentation for [Repositories](https://docs.dagster.io/overview/repositories-workspaces/repositories).

Then, you supply the inputs to the `pipelineName`, `runConfigData`, and `mode` like below. The `runConfigData`
is the same as the `run_config` parameter to `execute_pipeline`.

```python literalinclude caption=trigger.py
file:/trigger_pipeline/trigger_pipeline/trigger.py
startAfter:start_trigger_marker_2
endBefore:end_trigger_marker_2
```

Lastly, execute the query on the client to get the result.

```python literalinclude caption=trigger.py
file:/trigger_pipeline/trigger_pipeline/trigger.py
startAfter:start_trigger_marker_3
endBefore:end_trigger_marker_3
```

Before you run this example script, remember to launch the Dagit web server first.
You can either load the repository from a file or load from a module.
If you load from a Python file, run `dagit -f repo.py`.
If you load from a module, run `dagit -m repo`. Don't forget to change the input for
the first argument `location` as well. In this example, `repo.py` is changed to `repo`.
Then, open another tab in your terminal, run `python trigger.py` to execute the script.

```python literalinclude caption=trigger.py
file:/trigger_pipeline/trigger_pipeline/trigger.py
startAfter:start_trigger_marker_4
endBefore:end_trigger_marker_4
```

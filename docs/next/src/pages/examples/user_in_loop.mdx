This example demonstrates how to set conditions for whether a pipeline should pause or continue running.

## Set conditions

Imagine you have a pipeline that you donâ€™t want it to continue the computation until
certain condition is met.

For example, you have to wait for a file from someone else on your team.
Without the file, the pipeline should be paused rather than terminated.
Once you receive the file, you will continue running the pipeline to finish the computation.

You can use a while loop to check whether the condition is met.
Below is how you can set the conditions to check if the file path exists.

```python literalinclude caption=repo.py
file:/user_in_loop/user_in_loop/repo.py
startAfter:start_loop_marker_0
endBefore:end_loop_marker_0
```

In the example, `context.solid_config` is used to get the file path. The `config_schema` of the file path is a string.
When executing the pipeline, you can supply the `run_config` for the `file_path` like below:

```python literalinclude caption=test_user_in_loop_pipeline.py
file:/user_in_loop/tests/test_user_in_loop_pipeline.py
startAfter:start_loop_marker_1
endBefore:end_loop_marker_1
```

If the file doesn't exist according to the `file_path`, which means the condition is not met,
the while loop will check the condition again and again until the condition is met.

If the file exists, the condition is met and the loop breaks.
The pipeline will continue running to complete the computation.

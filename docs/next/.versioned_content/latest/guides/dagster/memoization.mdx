# Versioning and Memoization <Experimental />

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/memoized_development" />

This example is intended to describe how to use Dagster's versioning and memoization features. As of release `0.10.0`, Dagster has functionality for tagging a solid or resource with the _version_ argument of the decorator (ie `@solid(version="a")`, `@resource(version="b")`). This version argument is meant to be a representation of the state of the code contained by the wrapper.

Dagster can use versions to determine whether or not it is necessary to re-execute a particular step. Given versions of the code from each solid in a pipeline, the system can infer whether an upcoming execution of a step will differ from previous executions by tagging solid outputs with a version. This allows for the outputs of previous runs to be re-used. We call this process **memoized execution**.

The following example will walk through adding versions to a pipeline, and then performing memoized execution. Please note that versioning and memoization are experimental features, and are not yet intended for production use.

## Overview

Consider adding version information to the following pipeline.

```python file=../../memoized_development/memoized_development/repo.py startafter=start_mypipeline endbefore=end_mypipeline
from dagster import ModeDefinition, pipeline, repository
from dagster.core.storage.memoizable_io_manager import versioned_filesystem_io_manager
from dagster.core.storage.tags import MEMOIZED_RUN_TAG
from memoized_development.solids.dog import emit_dog
from memoized_development.solids.sentence import emit_sentence
from memoized_development.solids.tree import emit_tree


@pipeline(
    mode_defs=[
        ModeDefinition("memoized", resource_defs={"io_manager": versioned_filesystem_io_manager}),
    ],
    tags={MEMOIZED_RUN_TAG: "true"},
)
def my_pipeline():
    return emit_sentence(emit_dog(), emit_tree())
```

In order to enable memoization for this pipeline, we have tagged the pipeline with `MEMOIZED_RUN_TAG: "true"`, which indicates to the system that we should compute version information for outputs, and only run steps that have not been memoized. We also use <PyObject module="dagster.core.storage.memoizable_io_manager" object="versioned_filesystem_io_manager" /> as our `io_manager`, which is a <PyObject module="dagster.core.storage.memoizable_io_manager" object="MemoizableIOManager" />. It is required to use a `MemoizableIOManager` as the `io_manager`, so that versioning information can be retrieved from previous runs.

To enable memoization features on this pipeline, we will need to tag each solid (`emit_sentence`, `emit_dog`, and `emit_tree`) with a version.

## Computing Versions

In order to catch code changes individually from each solid, we will have each solid live in its own file, and have the version of each solid be a hash of the corresponding file.

Here is the code to hash a file in Python. Note that this code is not provided by Dagster, and is instead part of the example code:

```python file=../../memoized_development/memoized_development/solids/solid_utils.py
import hashlib


def get_hash_for_file(path):
    h = hashlib.new("md5")
    with open(path, "rb") as f:
        data = f.read()
    h.update(data)
    digest = h.hexdigest()
    return digest
```

And here is the definition of each solid, using file-hashing to compute the version:

```python file=../../memoized_development/memoized_development/solids/dog.py
from dagster import solid
from memoized_development.solids.solid_utils import get_hash_for_file


@solid(version=get_hash_for_file(__file__), config_schema={"dog_breed": str})
def emit_dog(context):
    breed = context.solid_config["dog_breed"]
    return breed
```

```python file=../../memoized_development/memoized_development/solids/tree.py
from dagster import solid
from memoized_development.solids.solid_utils import get_hash_for_file


@solid(version=get_hash_for_file(__file__), config_schema={"tree_species": str})
def emit_tree(context):
    species = context.solid_config["tree_species"]
    return "tree", species
```

```python file=../../memoized_development/memoized_development/solids/sentence.py
from dagster import InputDefinition, solid
from memoized_development.solids.solid_utils import get_hash_for_file


@solid(
    version=get_hash_for_file(__file__),
    input_defs=[InputDefinition("dog_breed"), InputDefinition("tree_species")],
)
def emit_sentence(_context, dog_breed, tree_species):
    return f"{dog_breed} is a breed of dog, while {tree_species} is a species of tree."
```

Notice that the `emit_dog` and `emit_tree` solids require config. In order to execute `my_pipeline`, we will provide the required config for these solids:

```yaml file=../../memoized_development/config/california_config.yaml
solids:
  emit_dog:
    config:
      dog_breed: poodle
  emit_tree:
    config:
      tree_species: douglas_fir
resources:
  io_manager:
    config:
      base_dir: "./results"
```

Before executing, we can use the [`list_versions`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-pipeline-list_versions) CLI to check which outputs have been memoized in their current state, and which will need to be re-executed:

```bash
dagster pipeline list_versions \
  -m memoized_development.repo \
  -c ./config/california_config.yaml \
  --mode memoized
```

This results in the following output:

    | Step Output          | Version                                  | Status of Output   |
    |----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
    | emit_dog.result      | 93815493adaeae4d55fdfa820891e0d40fb95f46 | to-be-recomputed   |
    | emit_tree.result     | 94d4620ffec745ef895719204424c16406646b99 | to-be-recomputed   |
    | emit_sentence.result | d367447b011cc2dcee083d5d9509477da746958b | to-be-recomputed   |

This matches expectation, as we have not run the pipeline at this point. Use the [`execute`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-pipeline-execute) CLI to execute the pipeline. **Note that memoized execution is not yet supported from Dagit.**

```bash
dagster pipeline execute \
  -m memoized_development.repo \
  -c ./config/california_config.yaml \
  --mode memoized
```

Let's see what happens if we change the config which we use to execute:

```yaml file=../../memoized_development/config/maryland_config.yaml
solids:
  emit_dog:
    config:
      dog_breed: poodle
  emit_tree:
    config:
      tree_species: red_maple
resources:
  io_manager:
    config:
      base_dir: "./results"
```

Notice that only the config to the `emit_tree` solid has changed. Therefore, the state of the output of `emit_tree` has changed, and we would expect the version to change. Note however that since the `emit_sentence` solid uses the result of `emit_tree` as input, the version of the output of `emit_sentence` should also change. We can verify this by again using the [`list_versions`](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-pipeline-list_versions) CLI.

```bash
dagster pipeline execute \
  -m memoized_development.repo \
  -c ./config/maryland_config.yaml \
  --mode memoized
```

This results in the following output:

    | Step Output          | Version                                  | Status of Output   |
    |----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
    | emit_dog.result      | 93815493adaeae4d55fdfa820891e0d40fb95f46 | stored             |
    | emit_tree.result     | 94d4620ffec745ef895719204424c16406646b99 | to-be-recomputed   |
    | emit_sentence.result | d367447b011cc2dcee083d5d9509477da746958b | to-be-recomputed   |

As we expect, the versions of outputs for `emit_tree` and `emit_sentence` have changed, indicating that if we run the pipeline again with the given config, these two outputs will be reconstructed. Note additionally that the result of the `emit_dog` solid is marked as stored, and its version has not changed, because the state of its inputs has remained the same. If we execute the pipeline again with the new config, we expect that the output of `emit_dog` will be retrieved from the previous run, and that only the `emit_tree` and `emit_sentence` solids will run.

# Releases and Changes

## Releases

We currently publish two kinds of Dagster releases:

- Minor releases, e.g. 0.7.0, 0.8.0. We publish a new minor release roughly every few months.
- Dot releases, e.g. 0.8.1, 0.8.2. We publish a new dot release at least once per week.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

We are in the 0.y.z of [SemVer](https://semver.org/). While technically this is "anything goes", we provide guidance to set expectations around deprecations and breaking changes:

- Upgrading to a new dot version within a minor release, e.g. 0.8.1 → 0.8.2, should never result in broken code. If a new dot version does break your code, please help us out by filing an issue on [github](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues).
- An exception to the above is “experimental APIs”, which allow us to offer new APIs to users and rapidly iterate based on their feedback. Experimental APIs will emit a warning whenever used, and may be broken even in dot releases.
- As often as possible, deprecation warnings will precede removals. E.g. if we’re currently on version 0.8.5, and we wish to remove an API, we’ll start issuing a deprecation warning when the API is used, and then we’ll omit it from 0.9.0.
- Upgrading to a new minor version, e.g. 0.7.5 → 0.8.0 may result in breakages or new deprecation warnings.
- We'll aim to batch deprecations every four weeks (or so).

## Following Along

The best way to stay on top of what changes are included in each release is through the [changelog](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/CHANGES.md). We call out breaking changes in “Breaking Changes” sections and deprecations in “Deprecations” sections.

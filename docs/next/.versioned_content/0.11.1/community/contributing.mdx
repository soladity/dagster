# Contributing

We love to see our community members get involved!
If you are planning to contribute to Dagster, you will first need to set
up a local development environment.

## Environment Setup

1. Install Python. Python 3.6 or above recommended, but our CI/CD
   pipeline currently tests against up-to-date patch versions of Python
   3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

2. Create and activate a virtualenv, using the tool of your choice.
   On macOS you can install `pyenv` with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
   ```

   Then add the following commands to your shell profile:

   ```bash
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
   ```

   and finally create and activate the virtualenev:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.7.4
   pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 dagster37
   pyenv activate dagster37
   ```

3. Ensure that you have node installed by running _node -v_, and that you have
   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If you are on macOS,
   you can install yarn with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install yarn
   ```

4. Clone the Dagster repository to the destination of your choice:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster.git
   ```

5. Run `make dev_install` at the root of the repository. This sets up a
   full Dagster developer environment with all modules and runs tests
   that do not require heavy external dependencies such as docker. This
   will take a few minutes. Note that certain sections of the makefile (sanity_check,
   which is part of rebuild_dagit) require POSIX compliant shells and will fail
   on CMD and powershell -- if developing on windows, using something like WSL or git-bash
   is recommended.

   ```bash
   make dev_install
   ```

6. Run some tests manually to make sure things are working:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest python_modules/dagster/dagster_tests
   ```

## Developing Dagster

Some notes on developing in Dagster:

- **Black/Pylint**: We use [black](https://github.com/python/black) to
  enforce a consistent code style, along with
  [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/). We test these in our CI/CD
  pipeline.
- **Line Width**: We use a line width of 100.
- **IDE**: We recommend setting up your IDE to format with black on
  save and check pylint, but you can always run `make black` and
  `make pylint` in the root Dagster directory before submitting a pull
  request. If you're also using VS Code, you can see what we're
  using for our `settings.json`
  [here](https://gist.github.com/natekupp/7a17a9df8d2064e5389cc84aa118a896).

## Developing Dagit

For development, run the Dagit GraphQL server on a different port than
the webapp, with any pipeline. For example:

```bash
cd dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/e04_quality
dagit -p 3333 -f custom_types_5.py
```

Keep this running. Then, in another terminal, run the local development
(autoreloading, etc.) version of the webapp:

```bash
cd dagster/js_modules/dagit
make dev_webapp
```

During development, you might find these commands useful. Run them from `dagster/js_modules/dagit`:

- `yarn ts`: Typescript typechecking
- `yarn lint`: Linting with autofix
- `yarn jest`: An interactive Jest test runner that runs only affected tests by default

To run all of them together, run `yarn test`.

## Developing Docs

To run the Dagster documentation website locally, run the following commands:

```bash
cd docs
yarn --cwd next dev  # Serves the docs website on http://localhost:3001
```

The API documentation is generated from ReStructured Text files (`.rst`), which extracts Python
docstrings from the library files. The `.rst` files can be found in the `docs/sections/api/apidocs`
directory.

If you change any `.rst` files, be sure to run the following command in the `docs` directory:

```bash
make buildnext
```

## Picking a Github Issue

We encourage you to start with an issue labeled with the tag
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
on the [Github issue board](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues),
to get familiar with our codebase as a first-time contributor.

Then, you can work on the issue labeled as [`good second issue`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/labels/good%20second%20issue)
which is more like a medium task.

When you are ready for more of a challenge, you can tackle issues with the
[most üëç reactions](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
We factor engagement into prioritization of the issues. You can also explore other labels and pick any issue based on your interest.
Feel free to contact us in our Slack channel [#contributors](https://app.slack.com/client/TCDGQDUKF/C01K91YP0TF) for any questions.

## Submit Your Code

To submit your code, [fork the Dagster repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo),
create a [new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) on your fork,
and open [a Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
once your work is ready for review.

In the PR template, please describe the change, including the motivation/context, test coverage, and any other relevant information.
Please note if the PR is a breaking change or if it is related to an open GitHub issue.

A Core reviewer will review your PR in around one business day and provide feedback on any changes it requires to be approved.
Once approved and all the tests (including Buildkite!) pass, the reviewer will click the Squash and merge button in Github ü•≥.

Your PR is now merged into Dagster! We‚Äôll shout out your contribution in the weekly release notes.

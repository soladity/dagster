============
Introduction
============

Dagster is an opinionated system and programming model for data pipelines. This process goes by
many names -- ETL (extract-transform-load), ELT (extract-load-transform), model production, data
integration, and so on -- but in essence they all describe the same activity: performing a set of
computations structured as a DAG (directed, acyclic graph) that end up producing data assets,
whether those assets be tables, files, machine-learning models, etc.

This repository contains a number of distinct subprojects:

- **dagster**: The core programming model and abstraction stack; a stateless single-node,
  single-process execution engine; and a CLI tool for driving that engine.
- **dagit**: Dagit is a rich viewer for Dagster assets, including a DAG browser, a type-aware
  config editor, and a streaming execution interface.
- **dagster-ge**: A Dagster integration with Great Expectations. (see
  https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations)
- **dagstermill**: An experimental prototype for integrating productionized notebooks into
  dagster pipelines. Built on the papermill library (https://github.com/nteract/papermill).
- **dagster-contrib**: A growing library of components for using Dagster with common data
  tools like Pandas and SQLAlchemy, along with worked examples.
- **airline-demo**: A substantial demo project illustrating how these tools can be used together
  to manage a realistic data pipeline.

step-by-step tutorial and notes on the demo project.
